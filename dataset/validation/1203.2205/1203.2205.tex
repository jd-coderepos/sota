\begin{abstract}
We propose a novel compressed sensing technique to accelerate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition process. The method, coined spread spectrum MRI or simply sMRI, consists of pre-modulating the signal of interest by a linear chirp before random -space under-sampling, and then reconstructing the signal with non-linear algorithms that promote sparsity. The effectiveness of the procedure is theoretically underpinned by the optimization of the coherence between the sparsity and sensing bases. The proposed technique is thoroughly studied by means of numerical simulations, as well as phantom and \emph{in vivo} experiments on a 7T scanner. Our results suggest that sMRI performs better than state-of-the-art variable density -space under-sampling approaches.

\section{Introduction}

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the signal of interest  represents the magnetization induced by resonance in the imaged tissues. In the standard setting, data acquired in MRI provide complete Fourier, or -space, measurements of this signal . Accelerating the acquisition process, or equivalently increasing the achievable resolution for a fixed acquisition time, is of major interest for MRI applications. Recent approaches based on compressed sensing seek to reconstruct the signal from incomplete -space information, hence defining an ill-posed inverse problem. The ill-posed inverse problem is regularized by the introduction of sparsity priors, acknowledging the fact that many MRI signals are sparse in well-chosen bases; i.e., that their expansion contains only a small number of non-zero coefficients. Such compressed sensing techniques have been developed for static and dynamic imaging \cite{lustig07, jung07, gamper08, jung09, usman11}, parallel MRI \cite{liang09a, lustig10, otazo10}, MR spectroscopic imaging \cite{hu08, hu10, larson10}, and many other applications. Several algorithms have also been proposed to reconstruct MRI signals from under-sampled -space measurements (see, e.g., \cite{kim07, trzasko09, kern11}).

In the framework of compressed sensing, signals are usually measured through random matrices to ensure that any sparse signal can be recovered with overwhelming probability. The common approach in MRI consists in also exploiting the fact that the energy of MRI signals is usually concentrated at low spatial frequencies. Therefore a variable density -space random sampling where the under-sampling ratio increases at high frequencies is usually used \cite{lustig07}. This method, heuristic in nature, was shown to be very effective in enhancing the signal reconstruction quality when random distributions optimizing the associated point spread function are used. Other approaches that optimize the acquisition procedure have also been proposed: -space sampling optimization by Bayesian inference \cite{seeger10}; random -space convolution with Toeplitz matrices \cite{sebert08, liang09b, wang09}; encoding by projection onto random waveforms with Gaussian distributions \cite{haldar10}.

In the present work, we propose the use of a spread spectrum technique to accelerate single coil MRI acquisition in the framework of compressed sensing. We study this method, coined spread spectrum MRI or simply sMRI, theoretically, numerically via simulations, and empirically via real acquisitions. The essence of our strategy consists of pre-modulating the image by a linear chirp, which results from the application of quadratic phase profiles, and then performing random -space under-sampling. Images are then reconstructed with non-linear algorithms promoting signal sparsity. The enhancement of the signal reconstruction quality is linked to a decrease of coherence of the measurement system \cite{puy11a, wiaux09b}. In MRI, this type of modulation is known as phase scrambling. It can be obtained by using dedicated coils or by modifying radio frequency (RF) pulses. It has been used for various purposes, such as improving dynamic range \cite{maudsley88, wedeen88}, or reducing aliasing artifacts \cite{pipe95, ito08}, but never in a compressed sensing perspective.

Let us acknowledge that this spread spectrum technique was initially introduced by some of the authors for compressive sampling of pulse trains in \cite{naini09}. Its transfer to a setting encompassing analog signals and modulations was studied in the context of radio interferometry \cite{wiaux09b, wiaux09d, mcewen10}. The effectiveness of the method for MRI was briefly discussed in \cite{puy09, wiaux09c, puy11b}.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:spread spectrum principle}, we explain the principle of the spread spectrum technique in a simplified analog setting. In Section \ref{sec:MR measurements}, we formulate the inverse problem for image reconstruction from under-sampled -space measurements in the presence of chirp modulation and compare the sMRI technique to the variable density sampling method on the basis of numerical simulations of MR acquisitions of a brain image. In Section \ref{sec:Real acquisitions}, we describe our implementation of the chirp modulation (on a T scanner) and show the effectiveness of sMRI using numerical simulations in this precise setting and real acquisitions of phantom and \emph{in vivo} data. Finally, we conclude and discuss potential evolutions of the
technique in Section \ref{sec:Conclusion}.

\section{Spread spectrum principle}
\label{sec:spread spectrum principle}

\subsection{Compressed sensing}
\label{sub:compressed sensing}

The essence of the recent theory of compressed sensing is the merging of data acquisition and compression \cite{candes06a, candes06b, candes06c, donoho06, candes07, baraniuk07a, rauhut10, donoho09}. Beyond MRI, it is well-known that a large variety of natural signals are sparse or compressible in multi-scale bases, such as wavelet bases. In the compressed sensing theory, signals are usually expressed as -dimensional vectors: . By definition, a signal is sparse in some orthonormal basis , called a sparsity basis, if its expansion contains only a small number  of non-zero coefficients. More generally it is compressible if its expansion contains only a small number of significant coefficients. The decomposition of  in  is denoted , and it satisfies



The theory of compressed sensing demonstrates that a small number  of linear and non-adaptative measurements  suffices for an accurate and stable reconstruction of the signal . These measurements may, for example, be obtained by projection onto  randomly selected basis vectors of an orthonormal basis , called a sensing basis. This selection process can be modeled by a multiplication with a rectangular binary matrix  that contains only one non-zero value on each line, at the index of the basis vector to be selected. To model a non-perfect sensing process, these measurements are assumed to be contaminated by independent and identically distributed noise . The measurement model thus satisfies

where the matrix  identifies the measurement matrix as seen from the sparsity basis ( denotes the conjugate transpose operation).

To reconstruct the signal  from the measurements , the compressed sensing framework proposes, among other approaches, to solve the Basis Pursuit () minimization problem \cite{candes06a, candes06b, candes06c, donoho06, candes07, baraniuk07a, donoho09, rauhut10}. This problem regularizes the originally ill-posed inverse problem related to (\ref{cs2}) with an explicit sparsity or compressibility prior on the signal. In the presence of noise, the  problem is the minimization of the  norm\footnote{ where  is the th entry of the vector .} of  under a constraint on the  norm\footnote{ where  is the th entry of the vector .} of the residual noise :

The corresponding reconstructed signal is . 

In this setting, the compressed sensing theory shows that if the number of measurements satisfies

for a universal constant , then  is recovered accurately by solving the  problem (\ref{cs3}) \cite{rauhut10}. In relation (\ref{cs5}),  is the mutual coherence between the sparsity and sensing bases. It is defined as the maximum projection, in absolute value, between the sparsity basis vectors , , and sensing bases vectors  ,  \cite{candes07, rauhut10}:

The spectrum of the resulting signal (bottom panel) spreads out in -space.}
\vspace{-1mm}
\end{figure}


The mutual coherence  plays a crucial role in relation (\ref{cs5}). Indeed, the number of measurements  needed to reconstruct -sparse signals increases quadratically with its value: . In the worst case where ,  is of the order of the signal dimension  and under-sampling is impossible. However, when the mutual coherence is at its minimum, ,  is reduced to the order of the sparsity level . This result can intuitively be explained with a simple consideration on the spread of the energy of the sparsity basis vectors in the measurement domain . In an incoherent orthonormal system, the absolute value of the scalar product between the sensing basis vector  and the sparsity basis vector  is small for all pairs of indices . As , the energy of the sparsity basis vector  spreads equally over the sensing basis vectors . Consequently, whatever index  is selected to perform a measurement, one always gets information concerning all the sparsity basis vectors describing the original signal. The number of measurements needed for accurate recovery thus decreases.

\subsection{Spread spectrum and coherence reduction}
\label{sub:spread spectrum and coherence}

\end{table}


The above considerations suggest that to reduce to the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery of MRI signals, one can try to modify the MRI acquisition procedure in such a way that the energy of the sparsity basis vectors spreads all over the -space. Following this idea, the sMRI technique introduces a linear chirp modulation of the signal of interest before random selection of -space coefficients (see Fig. \ref{fig:ssp principle}). Indeed, this modulation conserves the energy of the input signal and corresponds to a convolution that generically spreads the spectrum. 

To study theoretically the proposed acquisition scheme, we consider a simplified analog setting where the one-dimensional signal of interest is denoted by a complex-valued function  of the position . This signal is limited on a finite field of view . For the sake of simplicity of the following theoretical result only, we assume that the energy of this signal beyond the spatial frequency  is negligible\footnote{In section \ref{sec:MR measurements}, we will introduce a setting that properly takes into account the fact that, in general, MRI signals are not band limited.}. We thus sample this signal on a discrete uniform grid of  points and represent the resulting discrete signal by a vector . The vector  is assumed to be -sparse in an orthonormal basis . We also consider a one-dimensional linear chirp, with chirp rate , that reads as a complex-valued function . On the field of view , this linear chirp is approximately band limited at its maximum instantaneous frequency . This band limit can be parametrized in terms of a discrete chirp rate  and thus . 

In this setting, the sMRI measurement model is given by equation (\ref{cs2}) with

In the above equation, the matrix  represents an up-sampling operator needed to avoid aliasing of the modulated signal due to a lack of sampling resolution in a digital description of the originally analog problem. Indeed, the convolution in Fourier space induced by the analog chirp modulation implies that the band limit of the modulated signal is the sum of the individual band limits of the original signal and of the chirp . Therefore, an up-sampled grid with at least  points needs to be considered and the modulated signal is correctly obtained by applying the chirp modulation on the signal after up-sampling on the  points grid. The up-sampling operator , implemented in Fourier space by zero padding, is thus of size  and satisfies . The matrix  is the diagonal matrix implementing the chirp modulation on the up-sampled grid and the matrix  stands for the discrete Fourier basis on the same grid.

The sMRI sensing matrix  is not orthogonal because of the presence of the matrix . Consequently, the recovery condition (\ref{cs5}) does not strictly hold. However, one can obtain a similar recovery condition \cite{puy11a}. In particular, if

for some universal constant , then the vector  is accurately recovered with high probability by solving the  problem (\ref{cs3}). This result shows that the number of measurements  needed to reconstruct -sparse signals is proportional to the product  rather than to  only. The sMRI technique is efficient only if this product decreases with the chirp rate . In other words, the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery of sparse signals decreases only for sparsity basis  for which the mutual coherence  decreases faster than  increases.

\subsection{Illustration}
\label{sub:illustration}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9.2cm, keepaspectratio]{fig2.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:theory ssp} Probability of recovery of the signal  as a function of the number of measurements  for  (dotted black curve),  (continuous blue curve),  (continuous red curve),  (continuous black curve), and three sparsity bases: the Dirac basis (left); the Haar wavelet basis (middle); the Fourier basis (right).}
\end{figure}


We illustrate here the effect of the chirp modulation on the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery of -sparse signals.

We consider a -dimensional complex signal  of size  corresponding to one line of an MRI brain image. This signal is decomposed into three different sparsity bases  and hard-thresholded at a fixed sparsity . The sparsity bases considered are the Dirac basis, the Haar wavelet basis and the Fourier basis. This signal is then probed according to relation (\ref{cs2}) with  and , and reconstructed from different numbers of measurements  by solving the  problem (\ref{cs3}). Each time, the probability of recovery\footnote{Perfect recovery is considered to occur if the -norm between the original signal  and the reconstructed signal  satisfies: } of the signal is computed over  simulations. In this experiment, no noise is added to the measurements , and the indices  of the selected Fourier basis vectors  are chosen uniformly at random from .

The  reconstructions in the presence of chirp modulation with chirp rate  are denoted by . For each sparsity basis and chirp rate considered, the curves of the probability of recovery as a function of the number of measurements  are reported in Fig. \ref{fig:theory ssp}. The corresponding values of the product  are reported in Table \ref{tab:table Nmu}. 

For the Dirac basis, the number of measurements needed to reach a probability of recovery of  slightly increases with the chirp rate, as suggested by the values of  in Table \ref{tab:table Nmu} and relation (\ref{eq:analog recovery}). On the contrary, for the Haar and Fourier bases, the values of  in the table predict a drastic improvement of the results with an increase of the chirp rate. This prediction is confirmed by the results presented in Fig. \ref{fig:theory ssp}. Note that for the Haar and Fourier bases, the value of the product  decreases much less between  and  than between  and , suggesting a smaller improvement in the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery. This is also in line with the curves of the probability of recovery in Fig. \ref{fig:theory ssp}. In summary, as predicted by the theory, the effect of the sMRI technique depends on the sparsity basis. Note that the decrease of the performance for the Dirac basis (optimally incoherent only at ) is negligible compared to the improvement obtained for the two other bases. Note also that MRI signals are usually sparse in wavelet bases \cite{lustig07}. The results obtained with the Haar wavelet basis therefore suggest strong efficiency of the technique in MRI.

One can wonder if the proposed encoding scheme can result in shift-variant reconstruction quality. Indeed, the phase variation at the center of the chirp is less rapid than at the limit of the field of view. Let us consider the case of a signal sparse in the Haar wavelet basis. This signal can, roughly, be separated in large scale and fine scale sparsity basis vectors. The region where the chirp is oscillating slowly is limited to a small part of the field of view. Consequently, large scale sparsity basis vectors are necessarily affected by the chirp modulation as they have a wide support in signal space. The energy of these basis vectors is thus spread in -space thus improving the reconstruction quality of the low scale structures of the signal. On the other hand, the fine scale sparsity basis vectors at the center of the field of view remains not significantly modulated. However, these vectors are already incoherent with the Fourier basis as their energy naturally spreads out in -space. The fine scale structure of the signal are well recovered in absence and presence of chirp modulation. In summary, almost no shift-variant reconstruction quality is to be expected. 

Let us acknowledge that the idea of convolving the -space to optimize the acquisition procedure in the context of compressed sensing can also be found in \cite{sebert08, liang09b, wang09}. In these works, the -space is convolved by a random Toeplitz matrices. We should also note that the spread spectrum technique can be related to the random convolution approach where the signal is convolved by a random sequence and under-sampled in \emph{real space} \cite{romberg09}. In our case, convolution and under-sampling occur in \emph{-space}. Finally, let us mention that in a discrete setting, i.e., in the absence of band limit extension, replacing the linear chirp modulation by a random modulation leads to a universal encoding strategy, i.e., the reconstruction quality does not depend on the sparsity basis \cite{puy11a}. The sMRI technique tries to emulate this universal encoding strategy. A universal compressed sensing strategy might as well be obtained by projecting the signal  onto random waveforms with Gaussian distributions \cite{candes06c, donoho06}. In the context of MRI, an encoding strategy based on this sensing scheme was recently proposed in \cite{haldar10}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Quadratic phase profiles}
\label{sub:Quadratic phase profiles}

The spread spectrum principle was explained in the previous section in a simplified analog framework. Here, we move to a setting encompassing realistic analog MR signals which are limited in field of view and are consequently \emph{not} band limited.

Standard MR measurements take the form of  -space coefficients, with , of the original three-dimensional image probed representing the tissue magnetization as a function of the position inside a given field of view. This image is complex-valued due to magnetic field inhomogeneities \cite{haake99}. We consequently denote it by a complex-valued function  of the position , with components  in image space.  conventionally corresponds to the phase encoding directions, and  corresponds to the readout direction. The field of view is . We also consider quadratic phase profiles represented by a linear chirp in the phase encoding directions

with chirp rate . This linear chirp is characterized by an instantaneous frequency  at position . On the finite field of view , it is therefore approximately a band-limited function with approximate band-limits  in the phase encoding directions.

In this setting, MR measurements at spatial frequency  take the general form

In other words, the measurement  corresponds to the coefficient at spatial frequency  of a signal obtained as the product of the original image  with the linear chirp modulation . In the absence of modulation (), the measurements simply reduce to standard -space measurements. In the presence of quadratic phase profiles, the modulation amounts to the convolution of the Fourier transform of the chirp with that of the original image.

\subsection{Under-sampling in -space and the inverse problem}

All curves represent the mean relative error over  simulations, and the vertical lines represent the error at  standard deviation.}
\vspace{-3mm}
\end{figure*}


Let us assume that we want to probe the signal  at a resolution corresponding to a band-limit . Note that it does not imply that the signal is band-limited and some energy may remain beyond . At this resolution, the signal of interest is discretized on a discrete uniform grid of  spatial frequencies , , in -space, with , , and . In real space, this discretized signal may equivalently be described by its coefficients on a discrete uniform grid of  points  with . On this discrete grid, the linear chirp can be parametrized in terms of discrete chirp rates , thus exhibiting approximate band-limits  on the finite field of view .

We assume that the spatial frequencies probed span the -space up to the band-limits . We also assume that these frequencies belong to the discrete grid of points , so that we can avoid any re-gridding operation \cite{haake99}. Due to the linear chirp modulation, the measurements can contain significant energy from -space coefficients beyond the band-limits . Considering the estimated band-limits of the linear chirp, we choose to reconstruct the original signal  on a high resolution grid of  points in order to prevent any aliasing in the reconstruction algorithm from these high spatial frequencies. The sampled signal on this high resolution grid is denoted by a vector . The reconstructed signal is subsequently down-sampled at the desired resolution by keeping only its spatial frequencies belonging to the previously defined grid of size .

The -space coverage provided by the  spatial frequencies probed , with , can be represented by a binary mask in -space, equal to  for each spatial frequency probed and  otherwise. The measurements may be denoted by a vector of  -space coefficients , possibly affected by noise, which is denoted by the vector . In this setting, we consider an incomplete -space coverage (), in order to accelerate the acquisition time in comparison with a complete -space coverage. In order to satisfy standard MRI constraints, an arbitrary under-sampling can be considered in the phase encoding directions while all spatial frequencies in the readout direction  are probed. This form of under-sampling can directly be expressed in terms of an acceleration of the acquisition. Thus, the sMRI measurement model satisfies

where the matrix  encodes the complete linear relation between the signal and the measurements. The rectangular matrix  represents an up-sampling operation, implemented in -space space by zero padding. This operation is needed to avoid any aliasing of the modulated signal due to a lack of sampling resolution in a discrete description of the originally continuous problem. The modulated signal is correctly obtained by applying the chirp modulation to the signal after up-sampling on the grid of  points by zero padding in the  and  directions. The matrix  is the diagonal matrix implementing the chirp modulation on the up-sampled grid. The unitary matrix  stands for the discrete Fourier basis on this high resolution grid. The matrix  is the rectangular binary matrix implementing the mask. It contains only one non-zero value on each line, at the index of the -space coefficient corresponding to each of the spatial frequencies probed.

Regarding the reconstruction of the signal , (\ref{mri2}) represents the measurement constraint. We take a statistical point of view and consider independent Gaussian noise on each measurement. Considering a candidate reconstruction , the residual noise reads as . The noise level estimator, defined as twice the negative logarithm of the likelihood associated with , reads as

where the symbol  stands for the complex norm and  for the standard deviation of each of the real and imaginary parts of the noise component . This noise level estimator follows a chi-square distribution with  degrees of freedom. Typically, this estimator should be minimized by a good candidate for the reconstruction. As explained in \cite{candes06b}, the measurement constraint on the reconstruction may be defined as a bound , with  corresponding to some large percentile of the chi-square distribution. In the remainder of the paper, we choose the 99 percentile.

\subsection{Variable density sampling}
\label{sub:vds}

As discussed in \cite{lustig07}, the method selecting the spatial frequencies , with , is critical to achieve good reconstruction. Their approach is based on the use of a variable density sampling method. The distributions, which are empirically identified to provide optimized reconstructions, are defined by a power law decaying function  for some power  and real constant  ( and  is the highest spatial frequency of the -space domain to probe). In the present work, the spatial frequencies  are selected using the method\footnote{Toolbox available at \url{http://www.stanford.edu/~mlustig/SparseMRI.html}} of \cite{lustig07}: the values  are first thresholded to restrict them to the interval ;  independent binary random variables  taking value  with probability  are then generated; and finally the mask  selecting the -space coefficients for which  is created. 

Let us highlight the importance of the value  on the actual shape of the variable density profile. For a fixed power , this constant is computed beforehand in order to ensure that the number of measurements is, on average, equal to its target value . Given a fixed number  of measurements, we denote  the value of  for which . For a small value of  (), one would intuitively predict that the measurements spread all over the -space domain with the density of points higher at the center of -space. In fact, for , one has  and a whole -space region at high frequency remains unprobed. On the contrary, we have  for  and the -space is probed with a non-zero probability at the edges. Consequently,  is the first power that ensures that the entire -space domain is probed with a non-zero probability. Also note that for , the center of the -space is fully sampled, as , and that the size of the fully sampled region increases when  increases. 

In practice, the choice of the power  of the variable density profile is difficult and should be adapted with the number of measurements in order to obtain the best reconstruction qualities. In the absence of chirp modulation, we performed reconstructions for several values of  and noticed that  leads to the best performance\footnote{In practice,  is determined by an iterative process. Starting from , we increase its value by  until we obtain  for the number of measurements considered.}. In the presence of a linear chirp modulation, the power spectrum of the original signal is spread and flattened. However, in the range of the chirp rates studied, the power spectrum of the modulated signal remains peaked at the origin (Fig. \ref{fig:original image}). We therefore also apply a variable density sampling and choose the power  to be . Empirically, this value also leads to the best reconstruction qualities. Note that choosing  seems reasonable, as, given the spread of the information in the phase encoding directions, one wants to distribute the measurements over the entire sampling region of size  and also limit the size of the fully sampled region at the -space center. 

Let us acknowledge that recent theoretical results obtained in \cite{puy11c} support the choice of such profiles in MRI.

\subsection{Numerical simulations}
\label{sub:simulations}

\subsubsection{Simulation protocol}

To test the proposed technique, a real brain image is acquired on a  short bore, actively shielded, MR scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The subjects provided written informed consent prior to the imaging session, according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee. The parameters of the acquisition are as follows:  with a resolution of . The matrix size is thus . The standard clinical  sequence is used with echo time , inversion time , repetition time , and bandwidth . Note that, for the sake of simplicity, we restrict our analyses to one two-dimensional -slice of the original three-dimensional acquisition with an under-sampling in both phase encoding directions  and . Also note that the image used is complex-valued.

In order to model an analog acquisition scheme, the original image at a resolution of  is used to compute the measurements but the reconstruction is performed at a resolution of . The reconstructed images are compared to the image obtained with a full acquisition at  of resolution (Fig. \ref{fig:original image}).

The parameters of our analyses are as follows. Firstly, acquisitions are considered for various numbers  of complex measurements corresponding to coverages of , , , ,  and  percent of . Secondly, instrumental noise is also added to the measurements as independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian noise. The corresponding standard deviation  is identical for all the frequencies probed and we consider values of input \footnote{The  is defined as the ratio between the mean value of the complex magnitude of the original signal and the standard deviation of the noise .} of , with . Thirdly, the chirp modulation studied has the same chirp rate  in both phase encoding directions, i.e., , with values in the range . Fourthly, the signals are reconstructed by solving the  problem where the Total Variation () norm of the signal  is substituted for the  norm\footnote{The  norm of a signal is defined as the  norm of the magnitude of its gradient \cite{candes06a, rudin92}. \ Note that the recovery condition (\ref{eq:analog recovery}) does not hold with this norm. However, one can notice that the  norm of a signal  is very similar to the  norm of its decomposition in the Haar wavelet basis. In the light of the preliminary results of Section \ref{sub:illustration}, one can thus hope to obtain an improvement of the reconstruction quality in presence of chirp modulation.}. This problem is solved thanks the Douglas Rachford algorithm \cite{combettes11, fadili09}. Note that the  norm in combination with wavelet sparsity basis is, for example, used for reconstructing MRI signals from under-sampled -space in \cite{lustig07, liang09a}, or \cite{kern11}. For our problem, we tested several multiscale representations such as Daubechies wavelets, steerable wavelets, or curvelets, but the best reconstructions were obtained with the  norm. Finally, for each value of  and input  considered,  simulations are generated with independent noise and mask realizations, and the relative reconstruction errors  are computed for the variable density sampling and sMRI techniques. For each value of  and input , the discrete chirp rate  that gives the smallest relative error on average over the  simulations is recorded\footnote{sMRI toolbox available at \url{http://lts2www.epfl.ch/people/gilles}.}.

\subsubsection{Simulation results}

The magnitudes of the reconstructed images obtained with the sMRI and the variable density sampling techniques for an acceleration factor of  and an input  of  are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:simulated reconstruction 2D}, along with the corresponding error images (magnitudes of the complex-valued differences between the original image and reconstructed images). The relative errors of the reconstructions as functions of the input  for the six coverages considered and for both methods are reported in Fig. \ref{fig:curves error 2D}. 

For acceleration factors larger than , the sMRI technique with  provides better reconstruction than the variable density sampling technique with an improvement up to  of the relative error. Indeed, the relative error is, on average, lower in the presence of the chirp modulation. The corresponding standard deviations are also much smaller, indicating that the sMRI technique is more stable\footnote{Some leftover variability for the variable density sampling technique might still be removed by increasing the number of simulations. However, this would not modify the results and comparison with sMRI.}. At an acceleration factor of , the variable density sampling technique gives slightly better reconstructions than the sMRI technique with . However, with , the sMRI technique provides relative errors similar to those obtained with the variable density sampling technique. These results suggest to reduce the chirp rate as the number of measurements increases. This is coherent with the fact that modulation is not needed in the limit of no under-sampling.

When comparing the magnitudes of reconstructed images in Fig. \ref{fig:simulated reconstruction 2D}, differences between both methods do not appear obvious. However, one can notice that fine details are recovered better with the sMRI technique: the vessel (white spot) indicated by a blue arrow appears in the sMRI reconstruction, but not in the variable density sampling reconstruction. The error images bring more information, and one can notice that the errors are smaller in the presence of chirp modulation. In particular, the low scale structures, rendered incoherent with the chirp modulation, are better recovered.

\section{sMRI implementation and experimental results}
\label{sec:Real acquisitions}

\subsection{Implementation}
The sMRI technique is tested on the  scanner described in Section \ref{sub:simulations} with  acquisitions of a phantom and a human brain. For the brain experiment, the subjects provided written informed consent prior to the imaging session, according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee.

The chirp modulation is implemented through the use of a second order shim coil . In our implementation, the chirp rate varies linearly with the readout time  (or equivalently ) and is proportional to the intensity of the quadratic magnetic field : , where  is the gyromagnetic factor. The maximum chirp rate  is reached at , the mean chirp rate  at , and the minimum chirp rate  at  ( is the readout duration). This chirp modulation can be introduced in the measurement model by modifying (\ref{mri2}) as follows:

In the above equation,  and  implement the Fourier transform along the -direction and the -directions, respectively. The matrix  implements the chirp modulation. Signals are thus reconstructed on a grid of  points, and .

This modulation can be decomposed as a quadratic phase modulation in the  planes with chirp rate , combined with a linear phase modulation in . This linear phase modulation produces shifts of the original signal by an amount proportional to  along the  direction. The chirp modulation used is thus not ideal, as it creates distortions of the original object and complicates the measurement matrix. However, the energy of sparsity basis vectors is still spread by the main chirp modulation with chirp rate , and the previous conclusions based on theory and simulations should still hold. This will be confirmed by the numerical experiments of Section \ref{sub:numerical experiments}. Note also that the reconstructed images are free of any distortion as the complete effect of the modulation is modeled in (\ref{eq:real modulation}). Let us remark that these distortions might be avoided with the use of RF pulses or dedicated coils applied only during phase encoding.

As in Section \ref{sub:simulations}, the sMRI technique is compared to the variable density sampling method with . Full acquisitions () are performed both in the absence and in the presence of the chirp modulation. The number of phase encodings  is then reduced retrospectively by applying a mask on the complete data.

All curves represent the mean relative error over  simulations, and the vertical lines represent the error at  standard deviation.}

\end{figure}


The noise level is evaluated directly on the under-sampled data available for reconstruction. For each  pair measured, all the frequencies  are probed so that the signal is available as a function of . The level of the noise is estimated on probed pairs  at positions  that do not contain any signal. This noise level is identical in the presence and absence of chirp modulation.


\subsection{Numerical validation}
\label{sub:numerical experiments}

In this section, we perform simulations using the acquisition scheme described above to confirm that, even though the implementation of the chirp modulation is not ideal, the reconstruction quality is still enhanced with the sMRI technique.

The bottom row shows the error images (difference between the original image and the reconstructions) in the absence (left panel) and presence (right panel) of chirp modulation. For a better visualization, the error images were scaled by a factor of . The colormap for the error images goes from white to black, indicating low and high errors, respectively.}

\end{figure}


For this numerical experiment, a brain volume was acquired using the standard clinical MPRAGE sequence on a field of view of ,  and , with a resolution of  in each direction (, , ). The echo time is , the inversion time , the repetition time , the bandwidth . As in Section \ref{sub:simulations}, in order to model an analog acquisition scheme, the original image at a resolution of  is used to compute the measurements, but the reconstruction is performed at a resolution of . The reconstructed images are compared to the image obtained with a full acquisition at  of resolution. 

The parameters of our experiment are as follows. Firstly, acquisitions are considered for various numbers  of complex measurements corresponding to coverages of , ,  percent of . Secondly, instrumental noise is also added to the measurements as independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian noise. The corresponding standard deviation  is identical for all the frequencies probed and we consider values of input  of , with . Thirdly, the simulated chirp modulation has a chirp rate varying linearly with :  and . These values for the discrete chirp rate correspond to those used during the real experiment performed hereafter at  of resolution. However, relatively to the band-limit at  of resolution, the spectrum is naturally more spread than relatively to the band-limit at  of resolution. Therefore, for a reconstruction at  of resolution, the spectrum does not need to be spread as much as for a reconstruction at  of resolution. We thus divided the values of the chirp rate by  in both dimensions. Fourthly, the signals are reconstructed by solving the  problem where the  norm of the signal  is substituted for the  norm. Finally, for each value of  and input  considered,  simulations are generated with independent noise and mask realizations, and the relative reconstruction errors are computed for the variable density sampling and sMRI techniques.

The relative errors of the reconstructions as functions of the input  for the three coverages considered and for both methods are reported in Fig. \ref{fig:curves error 3D}. The magnitudes of a reconstructed axial slice obtained with the sMRI and the variable density sampling techniques for an acceleration factor of  and an input  of  are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:simulated reconstruction 3D}, along with the corresponding error images. Conclusions of Section \ref{sub:simulations} still hold with this acquisition scheme. The relative error of reconstruction is lower in the presence of the chirp for the three coverage considered. When comparing the error images in Fig. \ref{fig:simulated reconstruction 3D}, one can once more notice that the errors are smaller with the sMRI technique.

For the phantom experiment, a gradient echo sequence is used on a field of view of  in the three directions with a resolution of  (). The echo time is , the repetition time , the bandwidth , and the quadratic magnetic field intensity . The discrete chirp rates satisfy .

For the brain experiment, the standard clinical MPRAGE sequence is used on a field of view of ,  and , with a resolution of  in each direction (, , ). The echo time is , the inversion time , the repetition time , the bandwidth , and the quadratic magnetic field intensity . The discrete chirp rates satisfy  and .

Slices of the  reconstructions obtained with the sMRI technique for , ,  and  percent of phase encodings are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:experiments} for the phantom and brain acquisitions. The images obtained by inverse Fourier transform of the fully sampled -space (after correction of the distortions due to the small shifts in the  direction) are also presented. Fig. \ref{fig:comparisons images} provides a comparison of the reconstructed images obtained with the sMRI and the variable density sampling techniques. In the aim of providing further insight on how each method preserves image resolution or, in other words, captures shape and magnitude of high frequency features, we also provide one-dimensional spatial profiles in Fig. \ref{fig:comparisons profiles}. The white lines in Fig. \ref{fig:comparisons images} indicate the location of these profiles.

Firstly, as one would expect, the visual reconstruction quality improves when the number of phase encodings  increases. In the limit of a coverage of  percent, we cannot identify any loss of details between the reconstructed images and the ones obtained by inverse Fourier transform. Moreover, the reconstructed image contains much less noise than the image obtained by inverse Fourier transform. Indeed, at a coverage of  percent, the problem (\ref{cs3}) is essentially reduced to a denoising problem.

Secondly, as in Section \ref{sub:simulations}, the differences between both methods do not appear at first glance when comparing only the magnitudes of reconstructed images in Fig. \ref{fig:comparisons images}. Unfortunately here, the ground truth image is not accessible, so the corresponding error images cannot be displayed. However, a thorough visual inspection reveals that, for acceleration factors larger than , some fine details are better recovered by our approach. On the phantom reconstructions for acceleration factors of  and  (coverages of  and  percent, respectively), the separation between the two biggest circles is more visible. The shapes of the circles are also more curved. On the brain reconstructions for an acceleration factor of , the vessels at the center of image are still visible with our method but not with the variable density sampling technique. The cerebral cortex also appears sharper. For an acceleration factor of , the thin layer separating the two hemispheres of the brain remains more visible with the sMRI technique.

Thirdly, the reconstructed spatial profiles of the phantom presented in Fig. \ref{fig:comparisons profiles} show that the shape and magnitude of high frequency features are, more often, slightly better recovered with the sMRI technique for acceleration factors larger than  (blue and red arrows indicate features better reconstructed with sMRI and variable density sampling respectively). This improvement is much more significant on the brain data (see arrows), and holds for acceleration factors larger than .

Finally, the distortions are correctly taken into account by the operator , as both fully sampled slices of the phantom with and without chirp are identical (see Fig. \ref{fig:comparisons images}). For the brain images, some differences remain due to small movements of the subject between both acquisitions. Let us remark that no fitting of the chirp parameters (center and rates) was performed to improve on the theoretical values. This highlights sufficient stability of the technique relative to parameter approximations.

\section{Conclusion and discussion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

We presented a spread spectrum technique (sMRI) designed to accelerate MR acquisitions by compressed sensing. It consists of pre-modulating the original image by a linear chirp, which results from the application of quadratic phase profiles, and then performing random -space under-sampling. Non-linear algorithms promoting signal sparsity are then used for image reconstruction.

In the context of compressed sensing theory, the effectiveness of the technique is supported by a decrease of coherence between the sensing and sparsity bases due to the pre-modulation. Simulations in a simplified analog setting confirm that the enhancement of the image reconstruction quality is linked to the evolution of the mutual coherence. The sMRI technique was compared with the state-of-the-art variable density sampling using realistic numerical simulations and real acquisitions. Simulation results shows that the sMRI technique performs slightly better than the variable density sampling technique in terms of relative reconstruction error for acceleration factors larger than . The chirp modulation was also implemented on a T scanner with the use of a second order shim coil. Simulations of this implementation confirms again the slight superiority of sMRI. Visual inspection of reconstructions obtained from real acquisition of phantom and \emph{in vivo} data also shows that this first (non-ideal) implementation provides slightly better reconstruction qualities than the variable density sampling method. The sMRI technique thus outperforms the variable density sampling technique in terms of all the criteria used for evaluation.

Regarding future evolutions of the sMRI technique, an implementation of the linear chirp modulation with the use of RF pulses or dedicated coils could simplify the measurement scheme by applying the chirp modulation only during phase encoding in order to avoid object distortions, and, in turn, further enhance the reconstruction quality. Moreover, fitting the effective chirp center and rates on the basis of the data could improve the measurement model and result in better reconstructions.

Let us also emphasize the potential interest of the sMRI technique from an enhanced resolution perspective as, in the presence of the chirp modulation, the original image is reconstructed at a high resolution in order to avoid any aliasing problems. One can indeed consider reaching a higher spatial resolution for a fixed acquisition time without probing higher spatial frequencies in practice, which would require stronger gradient coils. In this context, any regularization approach adding a sparsity prior can help to synthesize spatial frequency information higher than that contained in the data. But the chirp modulation implies that high spatial frequency information is actually probed at lower frequencies. For illustration, Fig. \ref{fig:high resolution} shows a reconstructed  slice for a coverage of  percent on a high resolution grid  as well as the image obtained after downsampling on the grid . One can notice that the high resolution image provides sharper details with fewer aliasing artifacts. In particular, the vessels are better resolved.
