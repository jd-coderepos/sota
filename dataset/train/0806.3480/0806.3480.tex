\title{``Minesweeper'' and spectrum of discrete Laplacians}
\date{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The paper is devoted to a problem inspired by the ``Minesweeper''
computer game. It is shown that certain configurations of open
cells guarantee the existence and the uniqueness of solution.
Mathematically the problem is reduced to some spectral properties
of discrete differential operators. It is shown how the uniqueness
can be used to create a new game which preserves the spirit of
``Minesweeper'' but does not require a computer.
\end{abstract}



\section{Paper Minesweeper: history}


There is a certain class of mathematical problems which, being quite difficult to solve for an
adult mathematician in their most general setting, can be understood and even be approached to in
some particular cases by little kids. This paper is devoted to a problem of such a kind. Everybody
knows the ``Minesweeper'' computer game. A subset of a rectangular table is filled with ``mines''
and in every spare cell the number of neighbouring mines is indicated. The general problem can be
formulated as follows: given a subset of the spare part of the table with the correspondent numbers
of neighbouring mines, is there a unique way to reconstruct the original distribution of mines?

This problem in some simple cases can be used very fruitfully when teaching mathematics in primary
school, since it allows to do it while playing and does not actually require a computer. The first
experience of this kind belongs to the second author, who proposed for his pupils to reconstruct
the distribution of mines in tables of the following type:

The result was very successful, our colleagues in several Aveiro
schools started using such tasks.

The only practical problem we had was creating new tables so that the distribution of mines would
be determined uniquely by the open area (this simplifies checking whether the solution is correct)
and that the solution would not be too easy. Eventually, we found a form of the set to be open that
guarantees the existence of a unique solution, finding which in most cases requires some thought.
As an open set we propose to take the set of staggered cells of the initial table, in the form of a
chess table. In what follows we state and prove the corresponding theorem.






    \section{Formal description of the game.}
    In the first version of the present paper \cite{first} we
    restricted ourselves to the case of rectangular fields as it is in the
    classical computer ``Minesweeper'' game. Now we decide first
    to give a formal description of ``Paper Minesweeper''. The
    reason for such a formalization is that, as our experience
    with different types of fields shows, the spirit of the game is not strictly
    connected with the rectangularity of the field. Particularly,
    our experience with tables based on the triangle tiling of the plane
    shows that the paper version of this game encounters situations
    typical for the computer ``Minesweeper'' game.

       \subsection{General case}

Let  be a finite undirected graph\footnote{For the game it is
supposed     that  has a certain graphical representation, such
that each     vertex represents a cell in which either a ``mine''
or a number can potentially be located.}, with vertex set 
and edge set . We say that two vertices  are
\emph{neighbors}, if they are connected by an edge, that is, if
. Thus, for every  we can define its
\emph{neighborhood}, , as the the set of neighbors

A pair , where  and , is called an \emph{opening} if there is a
subset , such that for every ,


By \emph{solving} an opening  we shall mean finding the
corresponding set . Respectively,  will be called the
\emph{set of open cells} and  will be called the \emph{set of
mines}.

\begin{definition} \label{d:table}
An opening  is called a \emph{table for ``Paper Minesweeper''} if and only if it admits a
unique solution.
\end{definition}

Uniqueness of the solution gives the possibility to compare the obtained answer with the right one.
Besides that, it makes the game deterministic, i.e. the presence or the absence of a mine in each
cell is predetermined.

To prepare a table one can use the following algorithm: For each
two subsets ,  we
can define a function

By construction, the set  solves the opening ,
so it remains in this case to find out when the solution is
unique.














\subsection{Classical computer ``Minesweeper''}
  In the computer ``Minesweeper'' the table is an  rectangular subset  of
  , :
  
  For each  the set of its neighbours is defined as
  
  where
  


\subsection{Non-formal description}
To play the game we describe in its general setting you need a
playing field (for instance, printed on paper), a writing device
(for instance, a pen) and a solution table. The playing field
consists of ``open'' cells with numbers in them and ``closed''
cells which are to be filled by a player either with symbols of
mines (crosses, for instance), or by symbols of absence of mines
(dashes, for instance). The aim of the game is to fill ALL the
``closed'' cells in such a way that each number is equal to the
number of mines in the neighbouring cells. Each playing field
should be supplemented by the definition describing which cells
are to be called ``neighbours''. According to Definition
\ref{d:table}, a table with some of the cells filled by numbers is
called \emph{a playing field for ``Paper Minesweeper''} if the
distribution of mines can be restored uniquely. This particularly
means that a player can check whether the obtained solution is
correct by comparing it with the solution table.



\section{Statement of the main theorem}

 The first result in this direction appeared within the framework
of a project of the second author's department after proposing school students of the -th form
to reconstruct the distribution of mines in a table  with the upper string as
.\footnote{Special thanks to Prof. Ana Breda for organization of this project} At that time the
following theorem was proved:

\begin{theorem} \label{t:2_times_n}
Suppose that

and that  is not divisible by . let  be one of the two strings of :

Then for every  the opening

admits only one solution.
\end{theorem}

To prove Theorem \ref{t:2_times_n} we used inductive calculation of -diagonal determinants. The
argument is quite simple, so we skip it. Later on we obtained a more interesting theorem, which
makes the main result of this paper:

\begin{theorem} \label{t:chess}
Suppose that

the numbers  and  are coprime. Let  be the subset of
 in the form of a chess table:

Then for every  the opening

admits only one solution.
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Tables based on the triangle tiling of the plane.}


Let the neighbours of  be defined by the following rule:

where


If we associate naturally the vertices of this graph with
triangles in the triangle tiling of the plane, then this rule
means that two triangles should be called neighbours if they have
at least one common vertex (see fig. \ref{trig}).

\begin{theorem}\label{tr}
  Let  , and let  and  be not
  divisible by . Let neighbours be defined by the set . Suppose that  is a subset of 
  in the form of a chess table:
  
  Then for each set of mines  the opening  admits only one
  solution.
\end{theorem}

It should be noticed that, due to the larger number of neighbours, games based on such tables have
a higher level of complexity. It is curious that in these tables a player regularly encounters
situations similar to those in the computer game.

\section{An algorithm of table making.}


Before proving Theorem \ref{t:chess} we apply it to describe an algorithm of generating openings
with unique solutions. In most cases the resulting opening will be nontrivial to solve.

Suppose that  and  satisfying the conditions  of Theorem \ref{t:chess} are chosen. Set  to
be empty initially.

1. For every  we execute a Bernoulli test,
and if the result is , we add  to . The probabilities
 and  in the test can be taken equal to .

2. After having run through all the elements of  we define  by \eqref{fam}
and fill all the cells  with the values .

An opening with a unique solution is ready. Enjoy the game! Here are some examples of openings that
can be obtained this way:

 The solutions can be found at the
end of the paper.

The first step of the algorithm can be modified in order to avoid the situation when for some  one has

We propose to fill up the first row independently and then fill all the other rows, starting with
the second one and on downwards, filling each row from left to right and taking into account the
distribution of mines already placed.

Consider the following pseudocode:
\\ for i:=2 to m
\\ for j:=1 to n
\\ if  then put a mine into the cell (i,j)
\\ if  then leave the cell (i,j) empty
\\ end
\\ end

A table obtained by the application of this algorithm can have cells satisfying the condition
\eqref{easy} only in the last row. Thus, in general, such tables are already more complicated. But
if we want the inequality  to be valid for every  we
should apply the previous algorithm for all the rows but the last one. And for the last row we
should apply the following algorithm:
\\ for j:=2 to n
\\   \quad if  then put a mine into the cell (m,j)
\\   \quad if  then leave the cell (m,j) empty
\\  \quad if  then put a mine into the cell (m,j)
\\  \quad if  then leave the cell (m,j) empty
\\ end

    Note, however, that this procedure guarantees that there is no
    cell satisfying \eqref{easy} only in the case when the number of
    columns plus the number of rows is even. In the other case \eqref{easy} can hold for the
    cell .

These algorithms were realized in \\

\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{t:chess}.}


Consider the opening . Denote by  the set of characteristic functions
. We remind that there is a natural bijection between  and
the set of all the subsets of . Namely, each  corresponds to
the function  defined by the equality

Due to this bijection we can say that an element of  solves the opening meaning that
its support does. Now, the condition that a function  solves the opening 
can be written as a system of linear equations:


Since

we can rewrite \eqref{equat} as

We fix arbitrary orders on the sets . Given these orders we can consider the
matrix of the system \ref{equat2} and denote it by . This matrix is square, since  is even
and therefore . To prove the uniqueness of the solution of \eqref{equat2} it
suffices to show that  is invertible. Since the invertibility of  does not depend on the
order on , we shall not specify the latter.

Denote


Consider the real space . It is well known that the system  forms a basis in . Consider the operator  acting on  as
multiplication by :

Note that

Denote


It is easy to see that

Denote

The matrix of the operator  coincides exactly with the transpose of  (it is supposed
that bases in  and  are chosen in accordance with the orders on  and , which were used to define the matrix ). Thus it suffices to show that  is
invertible.

The subspace  is invariant under the action of . The restriction of  to 
coincides with . Thus, if we prove that  is invertible, so will be both 
and .

The spectrum of  coincides with the set

To show this it suffices to notice that the functions defined by the equalities

are eigenfunctions of :

We get that  is an eigenvalue of  if and only if there are integers , such that

But this is not so, since  and  are coprime.

Thus,  is invertible, which proves the theorem.


\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{tr}}


The proof is quite similar in this case, save that  now acts as

where the summation is taken over all the pairs

This operator is not symmetrical and thus cannot be represented as multiplication by a function in
. Same as we did before, we can define spaces  and , and operators 
and . Now our objective is also to find out whether  has maximal rank. Indeed, by
our definition of sets  and \eqref{sosedi:tr} we have  in case of odd
 and  in case of even  (see pict). In the latter case maximality of
rank means invertibility of .

By straightforward calculations we obtain that  acts as

where

or

We have

We cannot have , since , and so, . Hence
, which means that  is a multiple of , since

Thus, the second equation of \eqref{eqq} is equivalent to . This, together with the
first equation of \eqref{eqq}, implies that

Hence  is a multiple of  Theorem \ref{tr} is proved.
