\begin{abstract}
We consider a specific class of tree structures that can 
represent basic structures in linguistics and computer science such as \xml
documents, parse trees, and treebanks, namely, finite node-labeled sibling-ordered
trees. We present axiomatizations of the monadic second-order logic (\mso),
monadic transitive closure logic (\fotc) and monadic least fixed-point logic (\folfp) theories of this class of structures. 
These logics can express important properties such as reachability. 
Using model-theoretic techniques, we show by a uniform argument that these axiomatizations are
complete, i.e., each formula that is valid on all finite trees is provable using our axioms.
As a backdrop to our positive results, on arbitrary structures, the logics that we study are known to be
non-recursively axiomatizable.

\section{Introduction}



In this paper, we develop a uniform method for obtaining
complete axiomatizations of fragments of \mso on finite trees. In
particular, we obtain a complete axiomatization for \mso, \fotc,
and \folfp on finite node-labeled sibling-ordered trees. We take
inspiration from Kees Doets, who proposed in \cite{1987}
complete axiomatizations of \fo-theories in particular on the class of
node-labeled finite trees without sibling-order  
(see Section \ref{sec3}, where we discuss his work in more details). A similar result
for \fo on node-labeled finite trees with sibling order was
shown in \cite{1995} in the context of model-theoretic syntax
and in \cite{07} in the context of \xml query languages. We use the signature of \cite{07}
and extend the set of axioms proposed there to match the richer syntax of the logics we consider.

Finite trees are basic and ubiquitous structures that are of
interest at least to mathematicians, computer scientists
(e.g. tree-structured documents) and linguists (e.g. parse trees). The
logics we study are known to be very well-behaved on this
particular class of structures and to have an interestingly high
expressive power. In particular, they all allow to express
reachability, but at the same time, they have the advantage of
being decidable on trees.

As \xml documents are tree-structured data, our results are
relevant to \xml query languages. Declarative query languages fro both relational and \xml data are
based on logical languages. In \cite{1376952} and \cite{GottlobKoch},
\mso and \fotc have been proposed as a yardstick of expressivity
of navigational query languages for \xml. It is known that \folfp has the same
expressive power as \mso on trees, but the translations between
the two are non-trivial, and hence it is not clear whether an
axiomatization for one language can be obtained from an
axiomatization for the other language in any straightforward way.
One important and well-studied problem for XML query languages, as well as for
database query languages in general,  is
\emph{query optimization}. Typically, a query can be expressed in many
equivalent ways, and the execution time of a query depends strongly on
the way it is expressed. A common approach to database query optimization is
by means of a set of rewrite rules, allowing one to
transform a query expression into another equivalent one, together with
a cost model that predicts the execution time of a query expression on
a given database \cite{DBLP:books/aw/AbiteboulHV95}.
 In~\cite{CateMarxXPath20}, a sound and complete set of
rewrite rules for the XML path language Core XPath 2.0 was obtained
from a complete axiomatization of the first-order theory of finite trees,
exploiting the fact that Core XPath 2.0 is expressively complete for
first-order logic. We expect that the results we present here can be
used in order to obtain sound and complete sets of rewrite rules for
dialects of Core XPath that are expressively complete for \fotc and for
\mso, such as the ones presented in \cite{TenCate2006,1376952}.

In applications to computational linguistics, finite trees are
used to represent the grammatical structure of natural language
sentences. In the context of \emph{model theoretic syntax}, Rogers
advocates in \cite{521965} the use of \mso in order to
characterize derivation trees of context free grammars. Kepser
also argues in \cite{1047003} that \mso should be used
in order to query treebanks. A treebank is a text corpus in which
each sentence has been annotated with its syntactic structure
(represented as a tree structure). In \cite{2006} and \cite{1219706} Kepser and
Tiede propose to consider various transitive closure logics,
among which \fotc, arguing that they constitute very natural
formalisms from the logical point of view, allowing concise and intuitive phrasing of parse tree properties.\\

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section \ref{sec1} we present the concept of finite tree and the logics we are interested in together with their standard interpretation. 
Section \ref{sec2} merely state our three
axiomatizations. In Section \ref{sec3}, we introduce non standard semantics called \textit{Henkin
semantics} for which our axiomatizations are easily seen to be
complete. We prove in detail the \folfp Henkin completeness proof. Section \ref{sec4} introduces operations on Henkin structures: substructure formation and a general operation of Henkin structures combination. We obtain Feferman-Vaught theorems for this operation by means of Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e games. This section contains in particular the definitions and adequacy proofs of the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e games that we also use there to prove our Feferman-Vaught theorems.
In Section \ref{sec5}, we prove \textit{real} completeness (that is, on
the more restricted class of finite trees).
For that purpose, we consider substructures of trees
that we call forests and use the general operation discussed in Section \ref{sec4}
to combine a set of forests into one new forest. Our Feferman-Vaught theorems apply to such
constructions and we use them in our main proof of completeness, showing
that no formula of our language can distinguish Henkin models of
our axioms from real finite trees.
We also point out that every standard model of our axioms actually is a finite tree. 
Finally, we notice in Section \ref{secisftseclo} that a simplified version of our method can be used to show similar results for the class of node-labeled finite linear orders.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec1}





\subsection{Finite Trees}


A tree is a partially ordered set with a unique element called \emph{the root} and such that apart from the root, each element (or \emph{node}) has one unique immediate predecessor. We are interested in
\emph{finite node-labeled sibling-ordered trees}: finite trees in which the
children of each node are linearly ordered. Also, the nodes can be
labeled by unary predicates. We will call these structures
\emph{finite trees} for short.
\begin{defi}[Finite tree]
  Let  be a fixed finite set of unary predicate symbols.  By a finite tree, we mean a finite structure
  , where  is a tree (with
   the descendant relation) and  linearly orders the
  children of each node.
\end{defi}


\subsection{Three Extensions of First-Order Logic}
\label{seclog}
In this section, we introduce three extensions of \fo : \mso, \fotc and \folfp. In the remainder of the paper (unless explicitly
stated otherwise), we will always be working with a fixed purely relational vocabulary  (i.e. with no individual constant or function symbols) and hence, with -structures. We assume as usual that we have a countably infinite set of first-order variables. In the case of
\mso and \folfp, we also assume that we have a countably infinite set of set variables. The semantics defined in this section we will refer to as
\textit{standard semantics} and the associated structures, as \textit{standard structures}.


We first introduce monadic second order logic, \mso, which is the
extension of first-order logic in which we can quantify over the subsets of the
domain.
\begin{defi}
[Syntax and semantics of \mso]
    Let  stand for a first-order atomic formula (of the form
    , , or ),  a first-order variable and  a set
    variable. The set of \mso formulas is given by the following
    recursive definition:



We use  (resp. ) as shorthand for
 (resp. ). We
define the \textit{quantifier depth} of a \mso formula as the maximal
number of first-order and second-order nested quantifiers.
We interpret \mso formulas in first-order structures.
Like for \fo formulas, the truth of \mso
formulas in  is defined modulo a valuation  of variables
as objects. But here, we also have set variables,
to which  assigns
subsets of the domain. We let  be the
assignment which differs from  only in assigning  to  (similarly for ).
The truth of atomic formulas is defined by the usual
\fo clauses plus the following:


The truth of compound formulas is defined by induction, with the
same clauses as in \fo and an additional one:
\begin{center}
 iff there is  such
that 
\end{center}
\end{defi}

The second logic we are interested in is monadic transitive
closure logic, \fotc, which extends \fo by closing it under the
transitive closure of binary definable relations.

\begin{defi}
[Syntax and semantics of \fotc]
    Let  stand for a first-order atomic formula  (of the form
    , , or ),  first-order variables and  a \fotc formula (which, besides  and
    , possibly contains other free variables). The set of \fotc
    formulas is given by the following recursive definition:

We use  as shorthand for .
We define the \textit{quantifier depth} of a \fotc formula as the maximal
number of nested first-order quantifiers and  operators.
We interpret \fotc formulas in first-order structures. The notion of assignment and the truth of atomic formulas is defined as in \fo. The truth of compound formulas is defined by induction, with the same clauses as in \fo and an additional one:
\begin{center}
\\
iff\\
for all , if \\
and for all ,  and  implies ,\\
then .
\end{center}
\label{deftc}
\end{defi}


\begin{prop}
On standard structures, the following semantical clause for the  operator is equivalent to the one given above:
\begin{center}
\\
iff\\
there exist  with  and \\
and  for all 
\end{center}
\label{tcaltsem}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Indeed, suppose there is a finite sequence of points  such that , , and for each ,
. Then for any subset
 closed under  and containing , we can show by
induction on the length of the sequence  that
 belongs to . Now, on the other hand, suppose that there
is no finite sequence like described above. To show that there is
a subset  of the required form, we simply take  to be the
set of all points that can be reached from  via  by a
finite sequence. By assumption,  does not belong to this set
and the set is closed under .
\end{proof}

Intuitively this means that for a formula of the form  to hold on a standard structure, there must be a
\emph{finite} `` path'' between the points that are named
by the variables  and .

Finally we will also be interested in monadic least fixed-point logic
\folfp, which extends \fo with set variables and an explicit
monadic least fixed point operator. Consider a \folfp-formula
 and a structure  together with a valuation .
This formula induces an operator  taking a set  to the set . \folfp is concerned with \emph{least fixed points} of such
operators. If  is positive in  (a formula is positive in
 whenever  only occurs in the scope of an even number of
negations), the operator  is monotone (i.e.  implies ). Monotone operators
always have a least fixed point 
(defined as the intersection of all
their prefixed points).

\begin{defi}
[Syntax and semantics of \folfp]
    Let  stand for a first-order atomic formula  (of the form
    , , or ),  a set variable,  \fo-variables, ,  \folfp-formulas and 
    a \folfp-formula positive in  (besides  and ,  possibly contains other free variables).
    The set of \folfp formulas is given by the following recursive definition:

We use  as shorthand for . We define the \textit{quantifier depth} of a \folfp-formula as the
maximal number of nested first-order quantifiers and  operators.
Again, we can interpret \folfp-formulas in first-order structures. The
notion of assignment and the truth of atomic formulas are defined similarly
as in the \mso case. The truth of compound formulas is defined by induction,
with the same clauses as in \fo and an additional one:
\begin{center}
\\
iff\\
for all , if for all ,  implies ,\\
then .
\end{center}
\end{defi}

\begin{rem}
In practice we will use an equivalent (less intuitive but often
more convenient) rephrasing:
\begin{center}
\\
iff\\
for all , if ,\\
then there exists  such that  and .
\end{center}
\end{rem}

\subsection{Expressive Power}
\label{exppow}


There is a recursive procedure, transforming any \folfp-formula
 into a \mso-formula  such that  iff . The interesting clause is
. (The other ones are all of the same type, e.g. .) This procedure can easily be seen adequate by considering the semantical clause for the  operator.

Now there is also a recursive procedure transforming any \fotc formula
 into a \folfp formula  such that  iff . The interesting clause is
.
Let us give an argument for this claim. By Proposition \ref{tcaltsem} it is
enough to show that  holds if and only if there is a finite
 path from  to . For the right to left direction,
suppose there is such a path  with  and
. Then, for any subset  of the domain, we can show by
induction on  that if for all  (,  implies ,
then , i.e.,  holds. Now for the left to right direction,
suppose there is no such  path. Consider the set  of
all points that can be reached from  by a finite 
path. By assumption,  and it holds that , i.e.,
.


It is known that on arbitrary structures  (see \cite{ebfl95} or \cite{leo}) and on trees  (see \cite{1376952} and \cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/Schweikardt04}). It is also known that the (not \fo definable) class of finite trees is already definable in \fotc (see for instance \cite{2006}), which is the weakest of the logics studied here. We provide additional detail in Section \ref{sec53}.

\end{figure}





As many arguments in this paper equally hold for \mso, \fotc and
\folfp, we let  and use
 as a symbol for any one of them. The axiomatization of
 on finite trees consists of three parts: the axioms of
first-order logic, the specific axioms of , and the
specific axioms on finite trees.


To axiomatize \fo, we adopt the infinite set of
logical axioms and the two rules of inference given in Figure
\ref{fig:FO-axioms} (like in \cite{Enderton}, except from the fact
that we use a generalization rule). Here, as in \cite{Enderton}, by a 
propositional tautology, we mean a formula can be obtained
from a valid propositional formula (also known as the 
sentential calculus) by uniformly substituting formulas for the 
proposition letters). Alternatively, FO1 may be replaced by a 
complete set of axioms for propositional logic.
To axiomatize \mso, the
axioms and rule of Figure \ref{fig:MSO-axioms} are added to the
axiomatization of \fo and we call the resulting system .
COMP stands for ``comprehension'' by analogy with the
comprehension axiom of set theory. MSO1 plays a similar role as
FO2, MSO2 as FO3 and MSO3 as FO4. To axiomatize \fotc,
the axiom and rule of Figure \ref{fig:fotc-axioms} are added to
the axiomatization of \fo and we call the resulting system
. To axiomatize \folfp, the axiom and rule of Figure
\ref{fig:folfp-axioms} are added to the axiomatization of \fo and we
call the resulting system . We are interested in
axiomatizing  on the class of finite trees. For that
purpose, we restrict the class of considered structures by adding
to  the axioms given in Figure
\ref{fig:tree-axioms} and we call the resulting system
. Note that the induction scheme in Figure
\ref{fig:tree-axioms} allows to reason by induction on \emph{properties definable in } only.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:define-finite}
A finite structure  satisfies the axioms T1--T10 if and only
if  is a finite tree.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  It follows from the truth of T1, T2 and T5 that  is a tree.
  Note that T3 and T4 are valid consequences of T1, T2, T5 on finite
  structures.  Furthermore, T6, T7 and T10 imply that 
  linearly orders the children of each node (and that  only
  relates to each other nodes that are siblings). Note again that
  T8 and T9 follow from T6, T7 and T10 on finite structures.
\end{proof}

In fact, as we will see later, cf. Theorem~\ref{thm:define}, the
axioms T1--T10, together with the induction scheme Ind for
-formulas (where ) define
the class of finite trees.

We refer for basic definitions (e.g., \emph{proof} by which we mean \emph{formal deduction}, or \emph{axiomatization} by which we mean \emph{deductive calculus}) to \cite{Enderton} and sometimes only sketch or even omit classical arguments. E.g., we assume the notion of \emph{being substitutable} in a formula
to be clear for both objects and set variables. For details on such
basic notions and technics, we refer to the material extensively
developed in \cite{Enderton} and in particular, to the proof of the \fo
completeness theorem presented there. The Henkin completeness proofs
provided in Section \ref{sec3} are built on this classical material. 

We end this Section by spelling out some definitions that are specific to our paper.

\begin{defi}
We say that a -formula  is \emph{-provable} if 
occurs (as the last line) in some -proof and we say that it is \emph{-consistent} if its negation is not -provable. 

Let  be a set of -formulas and  a
-formula. By  we will
always mean that there are  such
that . Whenever 
does not hold, we say that  is -consistent. We say that  is -consistent if  is -consistent.
Finally, we say that  is a \emph{maximal consistent set} of -formulas if 
 is consistent, and for each formula , either
 or .

\label{defax}
\end{defi}

Now the main result of this paper is that on standard structures,
the  theory of finite trees is completely axiomatized by
. In the remaining sections we will
progressively build a proof of it.





\section{Henkin Completeness}
\label{sec3}

As it is well known, \mso, \fotc and \folfp are highly undecidable on arbitrary standard
structures and hence not recursively enumerable (by arbitrary, we mean 
when there is no restriction on the interpretation of the relation
symbols  from the signature, unlike in the case of, e.g., trees). 
So in order to show that our axiomatizations  are complete on finite trees, we refine a trick used by
Kees Doets in his PhD thesis \cite{1987}. We proceed in two steps (the second step being the one inspired by Kees Doets). First, we
show completeness theorems, based on a non-standard (so
called Henkin) semantics for \mso, \fotc and \folfp (on the general topic of Henkin semantics, see \cite{1950}, the original paper by Henkin and also \cite{230876}). Each
semantics respectively extends the class of standard structures with
non standard (Henkin) \mso, \fotc and \folfp-structures. By the
Henkin completeness theorems, our axiomatic systems
 naturally turn out to be complete on the
wider class of their Henkin-models. But we will see that compactness also follows from these completeness results and some of these Henkin
models are infinite. As a second step, we show in Section \ref{sec5} that \emph{no
-sentence can distinguish between standard and non-standard -Henkin-models among models of our axioms}. Every finite Henkin model being also a standard model, this entails that our axioms are complete on the class of (standard) finite trees, i.e., each -sentence valid on this class is provable using the system
. 

Now let us point out that Kees Doets was interested in complete axiomatizations of monadic ``-theories'' of various classes of
linear orders and trees. Considering such theories in fact amounts to considering \emph{first-order} theories of such structures extended with finitely many unary predicates. Thus, he was relying on the \fo completeness theorem and if he was working with non-standard models of particular \fo-theories, he was not concerned with non standard Henkin-structures in our sense. In particular, he used Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games in order to show that ``definably well-founded'' node-labeled trees have well-founded -equivalents for all . 
In Section \ref{sectproof}, Lemma \ref{lemma3}, which is the key lemma to our main completeness result, establishes a similar result for definably well-founded Henkin-models of the -theory of finite node-labeled sibling-ordered finite trees. Hence, what makes the originality of the method developed in this paper is its use of Henkin semantics: we first create a Henkin model and then ``massage'' it in order to obtain a model that is among our intended ones. Similar methods are commonly used to show completeness results in modal logic, where ``canonical models'' are often transformed in order to obtain intended models (see \cite{modal}). Remarkably, the completeness proof for the -calculus on finite trees given in \cite{DBLP:conf/fossacs/CateF10}, which is directly inspired by the methods used here, proceeds in that way. There are numerous examples of that sort in modal logic (and especially, in temporal logic), but there is also one notable example in classical model theory. In 
1970, Keisler provided a complete axiomatization of \fo extended with the quantifier ``there exist uncountably many'' (see \cite{keisler}). His completeness proof, which is established for standard models, is surprisingly simple, it relies on the construction of an elementary chain of Henkin structures and then uses the omitting types theorem. Hence all in all, these structures seem to provide a particularly convenient tool, not only for simple Henkin completeness proofs, but also for more refined completeness proofs with respect to interesting subclasses of Henkin models like standard models. 

Let us now introduce Henkin structures formally. Such structures are
particular cases among structures called \emph{frames} (note that such frames are unrelated to ``Kripke frames'') and it is convenient to define frames before defining Henkin-structures. In our case, a frame is simply a relational structure together with some subset of the powerset of its domain called its \emph{set of admissible subsets}. A Henkin structure is a frame whose set of admissible subsets satisfies some natural closure conditions.

    Let  be a purely relational vocabulary. A \textbf{-frame}  consists of a non-empty domain
    , an interpretation in  of the predicates in  and a set of admissible subsets .
\end{defi}
Whenever ,  can be identified to a standard structure. Assignments  into  are defined as in standard semantics, except that if  is a set variable, then we require that .
\begin{defi}
[Interpretation of -formulas in frames]
-formulas are interpreted in frames as in standard structures, except for the three following clauses. The set quantifier clause of \mso becomes:
\begin{center}
 iff there is  such that 
\end{center}
The  clause of \fotc becomes:
\begin{center}
\\
iff\\
for all , if \\
and for all ,  and  imply
,\\
then .
\end{center}

And finally the  clause of \folfp becomes:
\begin{center}
\\
iff\\
for all , if for all ,  implies ,\\
then .
\end{center}
\label{hensem}
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
[-Henkin-Structures]
    A -\textbf{Henkin-structure} is a frame  that is closed
    under parametric -definability, i.e., for each -formula
     and assignment  into :
\begin{center}

\end{center}
We call a -Henkin-structure  \emph{standard} whenever
every subset in  belongs to . 
\end{defi}

\begin{rem}
Note that any finite -Henkin-structure is a standard
structure, as every subset of the domain is parametrically
definable in a finite structure. Hence, non standard Henkin structures are
always infinite.
\label{rem}
\finremark
\end{rem}


\begin{thm}
 is completely axiomatized on -Henkin-structures
by , in fact for every set of -formulas
 and -formula ,  is true in all
-Henkin-models of  if and only if . \label{hencomp}
\end{thm}

We do not detail here the \mso proof, as it is a special case of the proof of completeness for the theory of types given in \cite{230876}. We focus only on the \folfp case, as the \fotc case is very similar, except that there is no need to consider set variables. Up to now we have been working with purely relational vocabularies. Here we will be using individual constants in the standard way, but only for the sake of readability (we could dispense with them and use \fo variables instead). Also, whenever this is clear from the context, we will use  as shorthand for . Let us now begin the Henkin completeness proof for \folfp. This will achieve the proof of Theorem \ref{hencomp}.

\begin{lem}[Generalization Lemma for \fo Quantifiers]
If  and  does not occur free in
, then . \label{fogen}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We refer the reader to the proof for \fo given by Enderton in
\cite[page 117]{Enderton}. The same proof applies for \folfp (as well
as \mso and \fotc).
\end{proof}



\begin{defi}
\label{folfpwit} We say that a set of \folfp formulas 
contains \folfp Henkin witnesses if and only if the two following
conditions hold. First, for every formula , if
, then  for some term  and if , then  for some monadic predicate .
Second, if  and  is a free variable of
, then  for some monadic predicate .
\end{defi}


The originality of the \folfp case essentially lies in the notion of \folfp-Henkin witness of Definition \ref{folfpwit}. 
In order to use this notion in the proof of Lemma \ref{folfplind}, we also need the following lemma:



\begin{lem}
Let  be a consistent set of \folfp-formulas and  a
\folfp-formula of the form  with  a fresh monadic predicate (i.e. not appearing in
). Then  is also consistent.
\label{lemma6}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose 
is inconsistent, so there is some proof of  from formulas in
. We first
rename all bound variables in the proof with variables which had
no occurrence in the proof or in  (this is possible since proofs are finite objects and we have
a countable stock of variables). Also, whenever in the proof the
\folfp generalization rule is applied on some unary predicate ,
we make sure that this  is different from the unary predicate
that we want to substitute by  and which does not appear
in the proof; this is always possible because we have a countable
set of unary predicates. Now, we replace in the proof all
occurrences of  by  (as we renamed bound variables,
there is no accidental binding of variables by wrong quantifiers).
Then, every occurrence of 
in the proof becomes an occurrence of , i.e., we have obtained a proof of
 from , i.e., from  ( is provable, as it can be obtained by
\fo generalization from a propositional tautology). It
entails that  is already inconsistent, which contradicts
the consistency of . Now it remains to show that the
replacement procedure of all occurrences of  by  is
correct, so that we still have a proof of  after it. Every
time the replacement occurs in an axiom (or its generalization,
which is still an axiom as we defined it), then the result is
still an instance of the given axiom schema (even for \folfp
generalizations, because we took care that  is never used in
the proof for a \folfp generalization). Also, as replacement is
applied uniformly in the proof, every application of modus ponens
stays correct: consider  and .
Obviously the result  of the substitution will allow to
derive the result  of the substitution from  and . Also  is simply ,
so the procedure gives us a proof of .
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}(\folfp Lindenbaum Lemma)
Let  be a countable vocabulary and let  with . If a set  of \folfp-formulas in vocabulary  is consistent, then there exists a maximal
consistent set  of  formulas such that  and  contains \folfp-Henkin
witnesses.
\label{folfplind}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let  be a consistent set of well formed \folfp-formulas in
a countable vocabulary .
We expand  to  by adding countably many new constants and countably many new monadic predicates.
Then  remains consistent as a set of well formed formulas
in the new language. We fix an enumeration of all tuples consisting of two \fo variables, one set variable and one formula
of :
\begin{center}

\end{center}
(this is possible since the language is countable), where the 
are formulas, the ,  are \fo variables and the  are set variables.
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item   Let  be ,
where  is the first of the new constants neither occurring in
 nor in  with .
\item   Let  be , where  is the
first of the new monadic predicates neither occurring in
 nor in  with .
\item   Let  be , where  is the first of the new monadic predicates neither occurring in  nor in
 with .
\end{iteMize}

\noindent Call  the set of all the .

\begin{clm}
 is consistent
\end{clm}
If not, then because deductions are finite, for some ,
 is
inconsistent. Take the least such . Then, by the
definition of consistency and the axioms of propositional logic,
. Now there are three cases:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item     is of the form , so both  and
.
Since  does not appear in any formula on the left, by Lemma
\ref{fogen}, , which contradicts the minimality of  (or
the consistency of  if ).
\item    is of the form . In such a
case both  and  hold. It follows that  . Since  does not appear in any formula on
the left, by \folfp generalization, , which contradicts the
minimality of  (or the consistency of  whenever ).
\item    is of the form .
By Lemma \ref{lemma6}, this is not possible.
\end{enumerate}
We extend  to a maximal consistent set
 in the standard way (see for instance \cite[page 137]{Enderton}).
\end{proof}


We will now show that if  is a maximal consistent set that
contains \folfp-Henkin witnesses, then  has a \folfp-Henkin
model .

\begin{defi}
Let  be maximal consistent and
contain \folfp-Henkin witnesses. We define an equivalence relation on the
set of \fo terms, by letting  iff
. We denote the equivalence class of a term
 by .
\end{defi}
\begin{prop}
  is an equivalence relation.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}\
By  FO5 and FO6.
\end{proof}



\begin{defi}
We define  (together with a valuation ) out of .
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item    is a \fo term 
\item    is a set variable or a monadic predicate where 
\item    iff 
\item   
\item   
\item   
\end{iteMize}
\end{defi}

\begin{prop}
  is a \folfp-Henkin structure.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
By construction of  which contains \folfp-Henkin witnesses, this is immediate (we introduced a
monadic predicate for each parametrically definable subset).
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}(Truth lemma) For every \folfp formula ,  iff .
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By induction on .

The base case follows from the definition of  together with the maximality of .
Now consider the inductive step:
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item   Boolean connectives and FO quantifier: exactly as in \fo (see
  \cite[page 138]{Enderton}), basically, for the \fo quantifier step we rely on the fact that  contains \folfp~ Henkin witnesses and we use the  formulas introduced in the proof of Lemma \ref{folfplind}.
\item    operator: we want to show that
\begin{center}

 iff

\end{center}
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item   We first show that
\begin{center}
 implies
    .
    \end{center}
    Assume , i.e., for all monadic predicate in  or set variable ,
    if  then there exists , such that  and
    . It follows by induction hypothesis that
    for every such , if , then there exists a term  such that  and
    . By maximal consistency of  and using the contraposition of the FO2 axiom, it follows that  
    for all monadic predicate in  or set variable  such that , it holds that
    .
    Now suppose . By maximal consistency of , we get .
    Then as  contains \folfp~ Henkin witnesses, there is a predicate  such that for some ,  is of the form . By maximal consistency of , it follows that . Hence there is a predicate  such that  and . But that contradicts the consistency of
    , as we previously showed that whenever , then also  . Then  and by maximal consistency of , .
\item   We now show that  implies
    . We consider the contraposition
      \begin{center}
       implies
    .
    \end{center}
    Assume . So  and there exists a monadic predicate in  or a set variable  such that ,  and
    for all ,  or . By induction hypothesis  and for all term , either , or . By maximal consistency of , for all term ,
    . Now assume . As  contains Henkin witnesses, there is some  and some term  such that  is of the  form  and hence , which contradicts the maximal consistency of . Hence .
 By maximal consistency of ,  and so also . Now suppose . Then by the LFP axiom,
    for every monadic predicate  in  or set variable , we get that  and so . But that
    contradicts the maximal consistency of . 
   \end{iteMize}
\end{iteMize}
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Every consistent set  of \folfp-formulas is satisfiable in a \folfp-Henkin model.\label{folfpcomp}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
First turn  into a \folfp maximal consistent set  with \folfp-Henkin witnesses in a possibly richer signature (with extra
individual constants and monadic predicates) . Then build a structure  out of this . Then the structure
 satisfies  under the valuation  and hence it satisfies also  ( being a subset of ).
\end{proof}

Compactness follows directly from Definition \ref{defax} and Theorem
\ref{hencomp}, i.e., a possibly infinite set of -sentences
has a -Henkin model if and only if every finite subset of it
has a -Henkin model. It also follows directly from Theorem
\ref{hencomp} that  is complete on the class of
its -Henkin-models. Nevertheless, by compactness the axioms
of  also have infinite models. We overcome this problem by defining a slightly larger class of Henkin structures, which we will call \emph{definably well-founded -quasi-trees}.\footnote{For a nice picture of a quasi-tree that is \emph{not} definably well-founded, see \cite{1995}.}
\begin{defi}
  A -\emph{quasi-tree} is any -Henkin structure 
  (where  is the set of admissible subsets of )
  satisfying the axioms T1--T10 of
  Figure~\ref{fig:tree-axioms}. A -quasi-tree is \emph{definably
    well founded} if, in addition, it satisfies all -instances of the
  induction scheme Ind of Figure~\ref{fig:tree-axioms}.
\end{defi}

With this definition, we obtain from Theorem~\ref{hencomp} the following:

\begin{cor}\label{henktreecomp}
A set of -formulas is -consistent if
and only if it is satisfiable in a definably well-founded -quasi-tree.
\end{cor}

\section{Operations on Henkin-Structures}
\label{sec4}

Let . As noted in Remark \ref{rem}, every finite -Henkin structure is also a standard structure.
Hence, when working in finite model theory, it is enough to rely on the usual \fo constructions to define operations on structures.
On the other hand, even though our main completeness result concerns finite trees, inside the proof we need to consider infinite (-Henkin) structures and operations on them. In this context, methods for forming new structures out of existing ones have to be redefined carefully.
We first propose a notion of substructure of a -Henkin-structure
generated by one of its parametrically definable admissible subsets:
\begin{defi}
[-substructure]
    Let  be a -Henkin-structure (where  is the interpretation of the predicates). We
    call  the relational structure underlying . Given a parametrically definable set , the
    -substructure of  generated by  is the structure ,
where  is the relational substructure of
 generated by  (note that  forms the domain of
, as the vocabulary is purely
relational) and .
\label{sub}
\end{defi}


Note that in the case of \mso and \folfp, we could also have defined  in an alternative way:


\begin{prop}
Take  and  as previously and consider the structure
,
where
. Whenever  is a \mso-Henkin structure or a \folfp-Henkin structure,  and  are one and the same structure.
\label{altsub}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Indeed, take . So there exists  such that . We want to show that also  i.e.  (which obviously holds) and . The second condition holds because both  and  are parametrically definable in , so their intersection also is (). Conversely, consider . As
 and  it follows that  (we can take ).
\end{proof}
Now, in order to show that -substructures are -Henkin-structures, we introduce a notion of \emph{relativization} and a corresponding \emph{relativization lemma}.  This lemma establishes that for every -Henkin-structure  and -substructure  of  (with  a set parametrically definable in ), if a set is parametrically definable in  then it is also parametrically definable in . This result will be useful again in Section \ref{sectproof}.
\begin{defi}[Relativization mapping]
Given two -formulas ,  having no variables
in common and given a \fo variable  occurring free in ,
we define  by induction on the complexity of
 and call it the \emph{relativization of  to
}:
\begin{iteMize}{}
 \item If  is an atom, ,
 \item If ,  (similar for ),
 \item If , ,
 \item If , ,
 \item If ,\\
  ,
 \item If , .
\end{iteMize}
where  is the formula obtained by replacing in  every occurrence of  by  and similarly for .
\end{defi}

Hence for instance, , which is satisfied in any model  of which the submodel induced by  contains an element satisfying .


\begin{lem}[Relativization lemma]
Let  be a -Henkin-structure,  a valuation on
, ,  -formulas having no variable in common and . If  for every variable  occurring
free in  and  for every
set variable  occurring free in , then . \label{rel}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
By induction on the complexity of . Let  be an
assignment satisfying the required conditions. Base case:
 is an atom and . So  (by hypothesis,  is a suitable assignment for both
models). Inductive hypothesis: the property holds for every
 of complexity at most . Now consider  of
complexity .
\begin{iteMize}{}
 \item   and . By induction hypothesis, the property holds for  and for . By the semantics of , it also holds for . (Similar for .)
 \item  and . By inductive hypothesis, for every node , . Hence, by the semantics of  and by definition of , .
 \item  and . As every admissible subset of  is also admissible in  (by Proposition
   \ref{altsub}) it follows by inductive hypothesis that for every  with , . Hence, by the semantics of  and by definition of , .
\item \sloppy and .
By definition of , the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[]
\item  ,
\item for all , if  and for all ,  and  implies , then .
\end{enumerate}
By inductive hypothesis, for all ,\\
 . Hence :
\begin{enumerate}
\item [] for all , if  and for all ,  and  implies , then ,
\end{enumerate}
By definition of , :
\begin{enumerate}
\item [] for all , if  and for all ,  and  implies , then ,
\end{enumerate}
We claim that :
\begin{enumerate}
\item []for all , if  and for all ,  and  implies , then ,
\end{enumerate}
which, by the semantics of , is equivalent to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item   [].
\end{enumerate}
It is clear that . For the  direction, assume . Take any set  such that  and for all ,  and  implies . Let . By Definition \ref{sub}, . Now by our assumptions on  and by definition of ,  only assigns points in . So as ,  and for all ,  and  implies . So by , . As , it follows that .
\item    and .
By definition of , the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [] ,
\item []  for all , if for all ,  implies , then .
\end{enumerate}
By inductive hypothesis, for all , , . Hence  is equivalent to :
\begin{enumerate}
\item [] for all , if for all ,  implies , then ,
\end{enumerate}
By definition of , :
\begin{enumerate}
\item [] for all , if for all ,\\
  implies ,\\ then ,
\end{enumerate}
We claim that :
\begin{enumerate}
\item [] for all , if for all ,\\
  implies ,\\
  then ,
\end{enumerate}
which, by the semantics of , is equivalent to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item   [].
\end{enumerate}
It is clear that . For the  direction, assume . Take any set  such that for all ,  implies .  Let . By Definition \ref{sub}, . Consider  such that . As  is positive in  and  does not occur in , . Also by hypothesis . Now as , by definition of , . So , i.e, 
and since we proved it for arbitrary , by , . As , it follows that .
\end{iteMize}
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Let  and  be as in Definition \ref{sub}. Then  is a -\emph{Henkin}-structure.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Take  parametrically definable in ,
i.e., there is a -formula  and an assignment
 such that . Now we know that

-formula  and an assignment  such that
. Assume
without loss of generality that  and  have no variables in common. We
define an assignment  by letting  for every
variable  occurring in  and  otherwise. The
situation with set variables is symmetric. Now by Lemma \ref{rel},

and hence . By definition \ref{sub} it follows that  (because ).
\end{proof}
There is, in model theory, a whole range of methods to form new structures out of
existing ones. Standard references on the matter are \cite{1959,2004}, written in a very general algebraic setting.
Familiar constructions like disjoint unions of relational structures are redefined as particular cases of a new notion of
\emph{generalized product} of \fo-structures and abstract properties of such products are studied. In particular, an important
theorem now called the Feferman-Vaught theorem for \fo is proven in  \cite{1959}. We are particularly interested in one of its corollaries, which
establishes that generalized products of relational structures preserve elementary equivalence. We show an
analogue of this result for a particular case of generalized product of -Henkin-structures that we call \emph{fusion}, this notion
being itself a generalization of a notion of disjoint union of -Henkin-structures defined below.
\begin{defi}[Disjoint union of -Henkin-structures]
  Let  be a purely relational vocabulary and ,
  with  a set of new  monadic predicates.
  For any -Henkin-structures  in vocabulary  with disjoint domains,
  define their \emph{disjoint union}  (or, \emph{direct sum})
  to be the -frame that
  has as its domain the union of the domains of the structures  and likewise for the relations, except for
  the predicates , whose interpretations are
  respectively defined as the domain of the structures  (we will use  to label the elements of ).
  The set of admissible subsets  is the closure under finite union of the union of the sets of
  admissible subsets of the . That is:
  \begin{iteMize}{}
    \item   
    \item    (with ) and 
    \item    iff  for some 
  \end{iteMize}
\label{union}
  \end{defi}

\begin{defi}[-fusion of -Henkin-structures]
Let  be a purely relational vocabulary and ,
with  a set of new  monadic predicates.
Let  be a function mapping each -ary predicate  to a quantifier-free first-order formula over  in variables
. For any -Henkin-structures
 in vocabulary  with disjoint domains, define their
\emph{-fusion} to be the -frame  that has the same domain and set of
admissible subsets as .
For every , the interpretation of  in
 is the set of
-tuples satisfying  in
.
\label{fusion}
\end{defi}

An easy example of -fusion on standard structures (it
is simpler to give an example on standard structures, as we do not have to say anything about admissible sets) is
the ordered sum of two linear orders , where
all the elements of  are before the elements of . In
this case,  consists of a single binary relation , the
elements of  are indexed with , those of  with
 and  maps  to . Another notable example of -fusion is the  -structure
, where  is the identity function and for each ,
 is the expansion of the -structure  in which  and   for every . In this sense, disjoint
union as we defined it above can be seen as a special case of fusion.

We show preservation results involving -fusions of
-Henkin-structures. Hence we deal with analogues of
elementary equivalence for these logics and we refer to
\emph{-equivalence}. Let us recall that by quantifier depth of a -formula, we mean the maximal number of nested quantifiers in the formula (by ``quantifier'', we mean \fo and \mso-quantifiers, as well as  or -operators).

\begin{defi}
Given two -Henkin-structures  and , we write
 and say that  and  are
\emph{-equivalent} if they satisfy the same -sentences. Also, for any natural number , we write
 and say that  and  are \emph{--equivalent} if  and  satisfy the same
-sentences of quantifier depth at most . In
particular,  holds iff, for all ,
 holds.
\end{defi}

Now we are ready to introduce the ``Feferman-Vaught theorems'' that we will show in Section \ref{apc} and which establish that -fusions of -Henkin-structures preserve
-equivalence, that is:

\begin{thm}
Let ,  be -Henkin structures. Whenever  for all ,
then also .
\end{thm}

We will also show in this section that every -fusion of -Henkin-structures is a -Henkin-structure.
Comparable work had already been done by Makowski in \cite{2004}
for extensions of \fo, but an important difference is that he only
considered standard structures, whereas we need to deal with
-Henkin-structures. Our proofs make use of
Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e games for each of the
logics . 

\subsection{Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"\i ss\'e Games on Henkin-Structures}\
\label{apb}

\noindent
Let . We survey Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e games
for \fo, \mso, \fotc, and \folfp which are suitable to use on Henkin structures.
We also provide an adequacy proof for the \fotc game. 
The \mso game is a rather straightforward
extension of the \fo case and has already been used by other
authors (see for instance \cite{1998}). The \folfp game is
borrowed from Uwe Bosse \cite{736408}. It also applies to Henkin
structures, as careful inspection shows. The \fotc game has
already been mentioned in passing by Erich Gr\"{a}del in \cite{736267}
as an alternative to the game he used and we show that it is
adequate for Henkin semantics. It looks also similar to a system
of partial isomorphisms given in \cite{1992}. However it is
important to note that this game is very different from the
\fotc game which is actually used in \cite{736267}. The two games
are equivalent when played on standard structures, but not when
played on \fotc-Henkin structures. This is so because the game
used in \cite{1992} relies on the alternative semantics for the
 operator given in Proposition \ref{tcaltsem}, so that only
finite sets of points can be chosen by players ; whereas the game
we use involves choices of not necessarily finite admissible
subsets. These are not equivalent approaches. Indeed, on
\fotc-Henkin structures a simple compactness argument shows that
the semantical clause of Proposition \ref{tcaltsem} (defined in
terms of existence of a \emph{finite} path) is not adequate.



Let us first introduce basic notions connected to these games. One
rather trivial sufficient condition for -equivalence is
the existence of an \emph{isomorphism}.  Clearly isomorphic
structures satisfy the same -formulas.  A more
interesting sufficient condition for -equivalence is that
of Duplicator having a winning strategy in all 
Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e games of finite length. To define this,
we first need this notion:

\begin{defi}[Finite Partial Isomorphism]
A \emph{finite partial isomorphism} between structures  and
 is a finite relation 
between the domains of  and  such that for all atomic
formulas ,  iff . Since
equality statements are atomic formulas, every finite partial
isomorphism is (the graph of) a \emph{injective partial function}.
\end{defi}

We will also need the following lemma:

\begin{lem}[Finiteness Lemma]
Fix any set . In a finite
relational vocabulary, up to logical equivalence, with these free
variables, there are only finitely many -formulas of quantifier depth .
\label{finitenesslemma}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
This can be shown by induction on . In a finite relational vocabulary, with finitely many free variables, there are only finitely many atomic formulas. Now, any -formula of quantifier depth  is equivalent to a Boolean combination of atoms and formulas of quantifier depth  prefixed by a quantifier. Applying a quantifier to equivalent formulas preserves equivalence and the Boolean closure of a finite set of formulas remains finite, up to logical equivalence.
\end{proof}

Now, as we are concerned with extensions of \fo, every -game will be defined as an extension of the classical \fo game, that we recall here:

\begin{defi}[\fo Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"\i ss\'e Game]
The \fo Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"\i ss\'e game of length  on standard structures  and  (notation:  is as follows.
There are two players, Spoiler and Duplicator. The game has  rounds, each of which consists of a move of Spoiler followed by a move of
Duplicator. Spoiler's moves consist of picking an element from one of the two structures, and Duplicator's responses consist of picking an element
in the other structure. In this way, Spoiler and Duplicator build up a finite binary relation between the domains of the two structures: initially, the
relation is empty; each round, it is extended with another pair. The winning conditions are as follows: if at some point of the game the
constructed binary relation is not a finite partial isomorphism, then Spoiler wins immediately. If after each round the relation is a finite
partial isomorphism, then the game is won by Duplicator.
\end{defi}

\begin{thm}[\fo Adequacy]\label{thm:effo}
  Assume a finite relational first-order language. Duplicator has a winning strategy in the game
   iff . In particular,
  Duplicator has a winning strategy in all EF-games of finite length
  between  and  if and only if .
\end{thm}


The proof for the first order case is classic. We refer the reader
to the proof given in \cite{ebfl95} or to the one in \cite{leo}.

For technical convenience in the course of inductive proofs,
we extend the notion of \fo parameter by considering set
parameters, i.e., instead of interpreting a set variable as a name
of the admissible set , we can add a new monadic predicate  to the
signature. The new predicates and the sets they name are called
set parameters. (This is similar to the \fo notion that can be
found in \cite{97}.) We will work with \emph{parametrized} (or \emph{expanded}) Henkin-structures, that is, structures considered together with partial
valuations. This means that the assignment is possibly non empty at the beginning of the game, which can start with some ``handicap'' for Duplicator, i.e., some preliminary set of already ``distinguished objects and sets''.

We first define a necessary and sufficient condition for \mso
equivalence by extending Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e games from
\fo to \mso. This game has already been defined in the literature, see for instance \cite{1998}.




\begin{defi}[\mso Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"\i ss\'e Game]
Consider two \mso-Henkin structures  together with ,
 and  together with ,  and , , . The \mso
Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e game  of length  on expanded structures
 and  is
defined as for the first-order case, except that each time she
chooses a structure, Spoiler can choose either an element or an
admissible subset of its domain. For a given  chosen by Spoiler, 
is expanded to . Duplicator
then responds by choosing  and
 is expanded to . The game goes on with the so expanded structures.
The winning conditions are as follows: if at some point of the
game  is not a finite partial isomorphism
from  to ,
then Spoiler wins immediately. If after each round the relation is
a finite partial isomorphism, then the game is won by
Duplicator.
\label{efmso}
\end{defi}


\begin{thm}[\mso Adequacy]\label{thm:efmso}
 Assume a finite relational \mso language. Given  and , , , ,  and  , , ,
 Duplicator has a winning strategy in the game  iff
  and  satisfy
 the same \mso formulas of quantifier depth . In
 particular, Duplicator has a winning strategy in all -games of finite length between 
 and  if and only if  and  satisfy the same \mso formulas.
\end{thm}

We omit the proof, because it parallels the \fo case.
The proof works regardless whether \mso is interpreted in the standard or in the Henkin way. What matters here is that the game-theoretic meaning of a ``quantification'' over a given ``domain'', lies in the choice of an element from that domain (including one consisting of ``higher-order elements'', e.g., sets).

\begin{cor}
For \mso-Henkin-structures ,  and , Duplicator has a winning strategy in  if and only if . In particular, Duplicator has a winning strategy in all -games of finite length between  and  if and only if .
\end{cor}


The \fotc game that we will be introducing now had been already mentioned in passing by Erich Gr\"{a}del in \cite{736267} as an alternative to the game he used. We will show that it is adequate on Henkin-structures.


\begin{defi}[\fotc Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"\i ss\'e Game]
Consider two \fotc-Henkin structures  and  together with
,  and , . The \fotc-game  of length  on expanded structures
 and  is
defined as for the first-order case, except that each time she
chooses a structure, Spoiler can either choose only one element or an admissible subset together with two elements of its domain.
In the first case we say that she plays an  (or point) move and in the second case, a -move (which we will define more precisely below).
Each point move results in an extension of the assignment  with elements . Each -move results in an extension of the assignment  with elements . At each round, Spoiler chooses the kind of move to be played. 

The  move is defined as in the \fo case. The -move is as follows:

Spoiler considers two pebbles  and  on the board (i.e., corresponding couples of parameters taken in each structure) and depending on the structure that he chooses to consider, he plays:
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item   either a set  with  and . Duplicator then answers with a set  such that
 and .  Spoiler now picks  and Duplicator answers with .
\item   or a set  with  and .  Duplicator then answers with a set  such
that  and . Spoiler now picks  and Duplicator answers with .
\end{iteMize}
In each -move, the assignment is extended with . After  moves, Duplicator has won
if the constructed assignment  is a
partial isomorphism (i.e. the game continues with the two new
pebbles in each structure, but the sets  and  are
forgotten).
\label{effotc}
\end{defi}


\begin{thm}[\fotc Adequacy]\label{thm:effotc}
  Assume a finite relational \fotc language. Given two \fotc-Henkin structures  and
  , ,  and , , ,
  Spoiler has a winning strategy in the game  iff
  there is a \fotc formula of quantifier depth  distinguishing  and .
\end{thm}

\proof\hfill

\begin{iteMize}{}

\item From the existence of a winning strategy for
Spoiler in the \fotc-game of length  in between  and , we will infer the
existence of a \fotc-formula of quantifier depth 
distinguishing  and .

By induction on .

Base step: With  round the initial match between distinguished objects must have failed to be a partial isomorphism for Spoiler to win. This
implies that  and  disagree on some atomic formula.

Inductive step: The induction hypothesis says that for every two
structures, if Spoiler can win their comparison game over  rounds,
then the structures disagree on some \fotc-formula of quantifier depth
.  Assume that for some structures , Spoiler has a winning strategy for the game over 
rounds. Let us reason on Spoiler's first move in the game. It can
either be a  or an  move.

If it is an  move, then it means that Spoiler picks an
element  in one of the two structures, so that no matter what
element  Duplicator picks in the other, Spoiler has an
-round winning strategy. But then we can use the induction
hypothesis, and find for each such  a formula 
that distinguishes  from .
In fact we can assume that in each case the respective formula is
true of  and false of  (by
negating the formula if needed). Now take the big conjunction
 of all these formulas (which is equivalent to a
finite formula according to Lemma \ref{finitenesslemma}) and prefix it
with an existential quantifier. Then the resulting formula is true
in  but false in . It is true in
 if we pick  for the existentially quantified
variable. And no matter which element we pick in , it will always falsify one of the conjuncts in the
formula, by construction. So, the new formula is false in . I.e.,  of quantifier depth 
distinguishes  and .


If Spoiler's first move is a -move, then it means that
Spoiler picks a subset in one structure, let say  (with  and ), so that
no matter which  (with  and ) Duplicator picks in the other structure, Spoiler can
pick ,  such that no matter which
,  Duplicator picks, Spoiler has an
-round winning strategy. For each  that might be chosen by
Duplicator, Spoiler's given strategy gives a fixed couple
. For each response  of Duplicator, we
thus obtain by inductive hypothesis a discriminating formula
 that we can assume to be true in
 for  and false in 
for . Now for each , let us take the big
conjunction  of all these formulas (which is finite,
by Lemma \ref{finitenesslemma}). We can then construct the big
disjunction  (again finite, by the same lemma) of all
the formulas .

Considering the first round in the game together with the inductive hypothesis, note that the \mso formula  holds in . Indeed, by induction
hypothesis, any couple  that Duplicator might choose in  will always falsify at least one of the conjuncts of
each . Finally, the formula  being constructed as the disjunction of all the formulas , any such couple
 will also falsify . Now the \mso formula  is equivalent to , which means that .

On the other hand for the same reasons, note that it holds in  that . Indeed, by induction hypothesis, for each  that Duplicator might choose in
 Spoiler will always be able to find a couple  satisfying all the conjuncts of the
corresponding formulas . Finally, the formula  being constructed as the disjunction of all the formulas , such a couple
 will also satisfy . Now  is equivalent to , which means that .

Let  be a name for the parameters  and  for .  of quantifier depth  distinguishes
 and .

\item[]From the existence of a \fotc formula of
quantifier depth  distinguishing  and  we will infer the existence of a winning strategy for Spoiler in
the game .

By induction on . 

Base step: Doing nothing is a strategy for Spoiler.

Inductive step: The inductive hypothesis says that, for every two
structures, if they disagree on some \fotc formula of quantifier
depth , then Spoiler has a winning strategy in the -round
game. Now, assume that some expanded structures ,
 disagree on some \fotc formula  of
quantifier depth . Any such formula must be equivalent to a
Boolean combination of formulas of the form 
and  with ,  of
quantifier depth at most . If  distinguishes the two
structures, then there is at least one component of this Boolean
combination which suffices for distinguishing them.

Let us first suppose that it is of the form . We may assume without loss of generality that
 whereas
. Then it means
that there exists an object  such that  whereas for every object , . But then we can use our induction
hypothesis and find for each such  a winning strategy for
Spoiler in . We
can infer that Spoiler has a winning strategy in . His first move consists in
picking the object  in  and for each response  in  of
Duplicator, the remaining of his winning strategy is the same as in
.

We now suppose that  of
quantifier depth  distinguishes the two structures. We may assume without loss of generality that
 i.e. it holds
in  that , whereas  i.e. it holds in  that
. We want to
show that Spoiler has a winning strategy  in
. Let us
describe her first move. She first chooses  and
 such that . By definition of , such a set exists. Duplicator has
to respond by picking a set  in  containing  and not . Spoiler then
picks  and  such that . This is possible because
by definition of , for any possible choice  of Duplicator (i.e., any set  containing  and not )
we have . But that means that Duplicator is now stuck and
has to pick  and  such that . Consequently, we have
,
whereas . As
 is of quantifier depth , by induction
hypothesis, Spoiler has a winning strategy in . The
remaining of Spoiler's winning strategy in  (i.e. after her first move, that we
already accounted for) is consequently as in .\qed
\end{iteMize}

\begin{cor}
For structures ,  and , Duplicator has a winning strategy in  if and only if . In particular, Duplicator has a winning strategy in all -games of finite length between  and  if and only if .
\end{cor}

Let us finally consider the \folfp case. There are two classical
equivalent syntactic ways of defining the syntax of \folfp: the one
we used in Section \ref{seclog} and another one, dispensing with
restrictions to positive formulas, but allowing negations only in
front of atomic formulas and introducing a greatest fixed-point
operator as the dual of the least fixed-point operator (also
 cannot be defined using  and has to be
introduced separately, similarly for the Boolean connectives).
This second way of defining \folfp turns out to be more convenient
to define an adequate Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e game. The game is
suitable to use on Henkin structures because the semantics on
which it relies is merely a syntactical variant of the one given
in Section \ref{sec3}. Now the \folfp-formulas  and , stating that a
point belongs to the least fixed-point, or respectively, to the
greatest fixed-point induced by the formula  satisfy the
following equations:
\begin{center}



\end{center}
Note that this holds no matter whether we be concerned with \folfp and \mso on
standard structures or on Henkin structures. The consideration of
these equations is the key idea behind an
Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e game defined by Uwe Bosse in
\cite{736408} for least fixed-point logic \lfp (i.e. where
fixed-points are not only considered for monadic operators, but
for any -ary operator). \folfp being simply the monadic
fragment of \lfp, the game for \lfp can be adapted to \folfp in a
straightforward way:

\begin{defi}[\folfp Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"\i ss\'e game]
Consider \folfp-Henkin structures  and  together with ,
,  ,
, , , . In the game
 of length ,
there are two types of moves, point and fixed-point moves. Each
move results in an extension of the assignment  with elements , and possibly (in the case of fixed-point moves) with
sets . Spoiler chooses the kind of move to be played. 
Now the following moves are
possible:

\begin{iteMize}{}
\item{ move: Spoiler chooses  and Duplicator .}
\item{ move: Spoiler chooses  and Duplicator .}
\end{iteMize}
In each point move, the assignment is extended by .
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item{ move: Spoiler chooses  with some pebble 
and Duplicator responds with .

Now Spoiler chooses in  a new element  and Duplicator answers in  with }
\item{ move:  Spoiler chooses  with some pebble 
and Duplicator responds with  such that .

Now Spoiler chooses in  a new element  and
Duplicator answers in  with .}
\end{iteMize}
In each fixed-point move the assignment is extended by 

After  moves, Duplicator has won if the constructed element
assignment  is a partial isomorphism and
for the subset assignment , for any  and :
\begin{center}
 implies 
\end{center}
We call an assignment with these properties a \emph{posimorphism}.
\label{effolfp}
\end{defi}

\begin{thm}[\folfp Adequacy]\label{thm:effolfp}
  Assume a finite relational \folfp language. Given two \folfp-Henkin
  structures  and , ,
  , ,
   and , , ,
  Duplicator has a winning strategy in the game  iff  and  satisfy the same
  \folfp-for\-mulas of quantifier depth .
\end{thm}
For a proof in the case of standard structures, we refer the reader to Uwe Bosse \cite{736408}. As pointed out earlier, the same argument works as well in the case of Henkin structures.



\subsection{Fusion Theorems on Henkin-Structures}
\label{apc}


Let . We show our analogues of Feferman-Vaught theorem for fusions of -Henkin-structures. We will refer to them as \emph{-fusion Theorems}, even though they will sometimes be formally first stated as corollaries. What we show is, more precisely, that fusion of -Henkin-structures preserve -equivalence for all fixed quantifier-depths.

In order to give inductive proofs for \mso and \folfp, it will be more convenient to consider parametrized -Henkin-structures where the set of set parameters is closed under union, this notion being defined below. This is safe because whenever two parametrized structures  and  are --equivalent, it follows trivially that  and  considered together with a subset of this set of parameters are also --equivalent.


\begin{defi}
Let  be a finite sequence of set parameters. We
define the sequence  as the finite sequence of set
parameters obtained by closing the set 
under union, i.e., . (We additionally assume that
this set is ordered in a fixed canonical way, depending on the
index sets .)
\end{defi}


\begin{thm}[Fusion Theorem for \mso]
Let  and  be -Henkin
structures, where . Furthermore, for , 
let ,  be sequences of first-order
parameters of the form ,
 (where  may depend on )
and 
,  sequences of set parameters of
the form , 
(where  may again depend on ).
Whenever  then also
.
\label{msofusion}
\end{thm}


\proof
We define a winning strategy for Duplicator in the game
 out of her winning strategies in
the games  by induction on .

Base step: , doing nothing is a strategy for Duplicator. We
need to show that  and  agree on all atomic formulas. Now in
the fusion structures, each atomic formula is defined by  in terms
of a -quantifier free formula that is evaluated in the
corresponding disjoint union structure. So it is enough to show that
the disjoint union structures agree on all atomic -formulas
and on their Boolean combinations. The initial match between the
distinguished objects in  and
 is a partial isomorphism for every
, so it is also one for  and
 i.e. the two disjoint union structures
extended with \fo parameters agree on all -atomic
formulas. We still need to show that it is also one for
 and
 i.e. the two
disjoint union structures extended with \fo parameters and the
closure under union of set parameters agree on all
-atomic formulas. It is enough to point that for every
parameter , for every  by construction of
 in , the following are equivalent:
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item ,
\item    for some  in .
\end{iteMize}
Similarly for every parameter , by construction of
 in , the following are equivalent:
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item ,
\item    for some  in .
\end{iteMize}
But by Duplicator's winning strategy in the small structure games, we
know that the following are equivalent:
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item    for some  in .
\item    for some  in .
\end{iteMize}
So the following are also equivalent:
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item ,
\item ,
\end{iteMize}
So the two extended disjoint union structures agree on all
-atomic formulas. Now relying on the semantics of
Boolean connectives, it can be shown by induction on the
complexity of quantifier free sentences that they also agree
on all Boolean combinations of atomic -sentences.

Inductive step: the inductive hypothesis says that whenever Duplicator has a
winning strategy in

for all , he also has one in
 We want to show that this also
holds when the length of the games is . Suppose Duplicator
has a winning strategy in the game

for all . We describe Duplicator's answer to
Spoiler's first move in the game .\\ It will then follow by induction
hypothesis, that he has a winning strategy in the remaining
-length game.
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item   Spoiler's first move is a point move. Suppose Spoiler
picks  in . Then  belongs to
 for some . So Duplicator uses his
winning strategy in

to pick ,
 so that he still has a winning strategy in .
 By induction hypothesis he also has one
 in the remaining -length \mso game between the following two structures:
 
 
and

\item   Spoiler's first move is a set move. Suppose Spoiler chooses a set
 in the set of admissible subsets of . Then  is necessarily of the form , with  an admissible subset of . We
now define locally his response ,
using his winning strategies in the small structures, so that he still
has a winning strategy in

for all . By induction hypothesis, he also has one
in the remaining -length \mso game between the following two structures:



and
 
(Note that this is enough,
because .)\qed
\end{iteMize}\smallskip

\noindent Now an analogue of this result for disjoint unions can easily be derived as a corollary of Theorem \ref{msofusion}. For the convenience of the reader, we provide here the detailed argument:


\begin{cor}
Whenever  for all  (with  a sequence of first-order
parameters of the form  with
 and  a sequence of set parameters of
the form  with ,
similarly for the  and ), then also
.\label{msounion}
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
Let  for all  (with  a sequence of first-order
parameters of the form  with
 and  a sequence of set parameters of
the form  with ,
similarly for the  and ).

Now consider the following expansions  and  of the  structures  and  to :
the interpretation of  is empty in  (respectively ) whenever  and it is the domain of  (respectively ) whenever .

Clearly  for all .

Now consider a mapping  such that for every -ary predicate , . By Theorem \ref{msofusion} we have that 

Corollary \ref{msounion} follows, because  are isomorphic (w.r.t.~) to  respectively.
\end{proof}

Another important corollary of Theorem \ref{msofusion} is the fact that fusions of \mso-Henkin structures are also \mso-Henkin structures.
Let us stress the importance of this fact, which is needed for the correctness of our main completeness argument.

\begin{cor}
 is closed
under \mso parametric definability and so  is a \mso-Henkin
structure.\label{msohenkinfusion}
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
First note that the following are equivalent:
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item    is \mso parametrically definable in ,
\item   for some , there is a finite sequence of parameters  such that
 is defined by a \mso formula  of quantifier depth 
using ,
\item  for some , for every two points , if they are \mso -indistinguishable using
, then  iff .
\end{iteMize}
Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is  \mso parametrically definable in
 using , but . So
it means that for some , 
is not \mso parametrically definable in  i.e. there are
two \mso parametrically indistinguishable points , . So for all , for all sequence of parameters
 in ,  and by the fusion theorem,\footnote{There is no need to consider the case where
 is empty, because if a set is parametrically
definable using no parameter, it is also definable using
parameters.}  But this entails that 
is not \mso parametrically definable in
 using , which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
 is closed
under \mso parametric definability and so  is a \mso-Henkin
structure.\label{msohenkinunion}
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Analogous to the proof of Corollary \ref{msohenkinfusion} (as
).
\end{proof}


Let us now consider the \fotc case. As  moves can only be played when there are already two pebbles on the board, it is more convenient to show first a version of our \fotc fusion theorem in which each small structure comes with at least two parameters. This allows us to define Duplicator's answer to a  move played in a big structure, by means of his winning strategies in the corresponding small structures. We then derive as a corollary the fusion theorem for non-parametrized structures.

\begin{thm}[Fusion Theorem for \fotc]
Let  and  be -Henkin
structures, where . Furthermore, for , 
let ,  be sequences of first-order
parameters of the form ,
 (where
 may depend on ), where each sequence 
(or  ) contains at least two
distinct elements, unless the structure 
(respectively, ) has
only one element. Whenever 
then also  
\end{thm}


\proof
We define a winning strategy for Duplicator in the game
 out of her winning
strategies in the games
 by induction
on .

Base step: , doing nothing is a strategy for Duplicator. We
need to show that the  and  agree on all
atomic formulas. Now in the fusion structures, each atomic formula is
defined by  in terms of a -quantifier free formula
that is evaluated in the corresponding disjoint union structure. So it
is enough to show that the disjoint union structures agree on all
atomic -formulas and on their Boolean combinations. The
initial match between the distinguished objects in  and  is a partial isomorphism for
every , so it is also one for  and
 i.e. the two disjoint union structures
agree on all -atomic formulas. Now relying on the
semantics of Boolean connectives, it can be shown by induction on
the complexity of quantifier free sentences that they also agree
on all Boolean combinations of atomic -sentences.

Inductive step: the inductive hypothesis says that whenever Duplicator
has a winning strategy in the game 
for some  satisfying the required
conditions on parameters and , he also has one in
the game .

We want to show that this also holds whenever the length of the game
is . Suppose Duplicator has a winning strategy in the game
 for all . We describe Duplicator's answer to Spoiler's first
move in the game . It will then follow by
induction hypothesis, that he has a winning strategy in the
remaining -length game.
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item   Spoiler's first move is an  move. Let Spoiler choose a point , then  for some . So Duplicator can use his
winning strategy in
 and pick a
corresponding point  in the other structure. Now he still has a
winning strategy in
. So by
induction hypothesis he also has one in the remaining  length
game 
\item   Spoiler's first move is a  move. Suppose Spoiler chooses a set
 in the set of admissible subsets of . Then  is necessarily of the form , with  an admissible subset (possibly empty)
of . Her response  can now be
defined locally for each  using her winning strategies in the
small structures. So let Spoiler choose .
Keeping in mind that each non single point small structure comes with
at least two distinct parameters, there are four cases:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item     in , there is a distinguished object inside, but also
outside , so Duplicator considers  together with these
two parameters and constructs  by using his winning strategy
in .
\item   in , only distinguished objects exist
inside \footnote{Note that as a special case we may have
.}, so Duplicator considers any one of these
distinguished objects, say , and looks at  together with some parameter inside .  Then he can
use his winning strategy in
 to construct
an answer that we call . Now ;
\item in , only distinguished objects exist outside
  ,\footnote{Note that as a special case we may have
  .} so Duplicator similarly considers some
  distinguished object  and looks at  together
  with some other parameter outside , so that he can construct an
  answer that we call  by using his winning strategy in
  . Now
  ;
\item     is a single point structure, then
 if  and  if
.
\end{enumerate}
Once  has been constructed, Spoiler
picks two points  and . There are two cases:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item   and  belong to the domain of one and the same small structure  ; now 
is as previously described in  (but not , because
two distinct points cannot belong to one and the same single point
structure) and in each case Duplicator does the following:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item He uses his winning strategy in the game
   to answer
  with , so that he still has a winning strategy in
  . By
  induction hypothesis he also has one in the remaining  length
  game 
\item   Suppose initially that . Now Duplicator
considers  together with  and
some other parameter inside this set.  Then he uses his winning strategy
in  to pick
corresponding  in , so that he still has a winning
strategy in
. By
induction hypothesis he also has one in the remaining  length
game  
Next, suppose
. Then we choose . The parameter  already matches
 i.e., Duplicator has a winning strategy in
 that he may
use to pick
, thus answering as if it was a point move (i.e.,  has to be
-equivalent to ).  Therefore Duplicator still has a winning strategy
in .
By induction hypothesis he also has one in the remaining 
length game  This works, except that there is the additional condition
 that Duplicator must
also maintain in order to respect the rules of the game. A slightly more refined argument shows, however
that there
has to be an -equivalent point to  which is outside .
Indeed, instead of , Spoiler could have picked any other point
 together with  and Duplicator's
winning strategy would have provided a correct answer , , which means that Duplicator would have found
some point  which is at least -equivalent to  and lies
outside  (because if Duplicator has a winning strategy in

then he has one in
 as well,
and consequently also in
).
\item  Suppose initially that .  Then Duplicator
considers  together with  and with some
other parameter outside this set and uses his winning strategy in
, so that he
still has a winning strategy in
. By
induction hypothesis he also has one in the remaining  length
game  otherwise
, then  because the parameter  already
matches  i.e., Duplicator has a winning strategy in
 so we
can show by a similar argument as above
that he can use it to pick , so that he still has a winning strategy in
. By
induction hypothesis he also has one in the remaining  length
game 
\end{enumerate}
\item      otherwise  and  with ;
we can again use a similar argument to show that Duplicator can
use his winning strategy in
 to pick ,
 in the right part of the structure (that is, inside or outside
), so that he still has a winning strategy in the games\\
 and
 (in the
special case where for instance,  is a single point structure,
Duplicator picks the only available point in the other structure).
By induction hypothesis he also has one in the remaining 
length game 
\end{enumerate}
\end{iteMize}



\noindent We now show a corollary of the preceding lemma, in which the
small structures do not come with any distinguished objects:
\begin{cor}
Whenever  for all ,
then also .\label{fotcfusion}
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
We know that Spoiler's first two moves in
the \fotc-game of length  between  and
 must be quantifier
moves, because the  move can only be played once there are two
pebbles on the board. Let us look at the first move. Suppose
Spoiler plays a point . So  for some . By
Duplicator's winning strategy in , he
has an answer  such that . Let us rename  with  and
 with . Similarly, for every  such that , fix some random point  coming from the
domain of , Spoiler could have played this point and so
Duplicator would have had an adequate answer  such that
. Now for the
second round in the game, some point  or 
coming from the domain of respectively  or  will
be played by Spoiler and Duplicator will be able to answer so that
. Similarly, for each  such that
, we can find points such that . Now as for all , Duplicator has a winning strategy in
,
by the previous lemma, he has one in
 so
he also has one in .

In the \folfp case, the situation parallels the \fotc case. As  moves can only be played when there is already one pebble on the board, it is more convenient to show first a version of our \folfp fusion theorem in which each small structure comes with at least one \fo parameter. This allows us to define Duplicator's answer to a  move played in the big structure, by means of his winning strategies in the small structures. We then derive as a corollary the fusion theorem for non-parametrized structures.

\begin{thm}[Fusion Theorem for \folfp]
Let ,  be \emph{non empty} sequences of first-order
parameters of the form , , with
 and ,  sequences of set parameters of
the form ,  with .
Whenever

then also 
\end{thm}

\proof
We proceed by induction on , defining a winning strategy for Duplicator in the game ,\\
 out of her winning strategies in
the games
.

Base step: , doing nothing is a strategy for Duplicator (this can be justified by a similar argument as in the \mso case).

Inductive step: the inductive hypothesis says that whenever Duplicator has a winning strategy
in

for pairs of structures

satisfying the required conditions on parameters with , he also has one in .

We want to show that this also holds when the length of the games
is . Suppose Duplicator has a winning strategy in

for all . We describe Duplicator's answer to
Spoiler's first move in the \folfp-game of length  in between  and . It then follows by induction
hypothesis, that he has a winning strategy in the remaining
-length game.
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item   Spoiler's first move is an  move.

Same argument as for \mso and \fotc.
\item   Spoiler's first move is a  move.

Symmetric.
\item   Spoiler's first move is a GFP move.

Suppose Spoiler chooses a set  in the set of admissible subsets
of  with some pebble
. Then  is necessarily of the form , with  an admissible subset of . Her
response  can now be defined locally
for each  using her winning strategies in the small structures.
So let Spoiler choose . Keeping in
mind that each small structure comes with at least one parameter,
there are four cases:
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item     in , there is a distinguished object inside  and ,
so Duplicator considers  together with this parameter and
constructs  by using his winning strategy in
.
\item  in , there are only distinguished objects
outside , so Duplicator considers
any  among those and looks at
, so that he can use his winning strategy in

to construct an answer that we call . Now
. This is a correct answer, because
the (posimorphism) condition to be maintained (see Definition \ref{effolfp}) is that for every
pebble  on the board at the end of the game, . But by Duplicator's winning strategy in
, we
know already that for every such pebble, , so also , since the winning conditions will
  assure that  if and only if .
\item  . So
. As pebbles are only chosen using Duplicator's
winning strategies in the small structures, the posimorphism condition
will be maintained.
\item     . So . As no pebble can belong to this set, the
posimorphism condition will be maintained.
\end{enumerate}
Now that  has been constructed,
Spoiler picks a new element  which belongs to the domain
of one particular small structure  (so ) and
 is as previously described either in ,  or
 (but not , because  cannot belong to the empty set)
and in each case Duplicator does the following:
\begin{enumerate}[1)] 
\item    Duplicator answers with  according to his
winning strategy in

\item  Duplicator again considers  and
answers according to his winning strategy in
. This
is safe, because the pebble to be chosen may be assumed to be fresh, so it
won't be ;
\item   Duplicator picks
a random pebble  and considers
. His winning strategy provides him
with a correct answer.
\end{enumerate}
So in any of these cases (either ,  or ), Duplicator has a
winning strategy in the game
.
Now for all , , he also has one in
.
So by induction hypothesis, he has one in the remaining -length \folfp
game between the following two structures:


and

\item   Spoiler's first move is a  move.

Symmetric.\qed
\end{iteMize}


\begin{cor}
Whenever  for all ,
then it also holds that .\label{folfpfusion}
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
We know that Spoiler's first move in
 must be a \fo
quantifier move, because the  move can only be played once
there is a pebble on the board. Let us look at the first move.
Suppose Spoiler plays a point . So  for some . By Duplicator's winning strategy in , he has an answer  such that
. Let us rename  with
 and  with . Similarly, for every  such that
, fix some random point  coming from the
domain of , Spoiler could have played this point and so
Duplicator would have had an adequate answer  such that
. Now as for all , Duplicator has a winning strategy in
, by the previous lemma,
he has one in , so he also has one in
.
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}
Whenever  for all ,
then it also holds that .\label{folfpunion}

\begin{proof}
Analogous to the proof of Corollary \ref{msounion}.

\section{Putting it Together: Completeness on Finite Trees}
\label{sec5}

\subsection{Forests and Operations on Forests}

In Section \ref{sectproof}, we will prove that no -sentence can
distinguish -Henkin-models of 
from standard models of . More precisely,
we will show that for each , every definably
well-founded -quasi-tree is --equivalent to a finite
tree. In order to give an inductive proof, it will be more convenient
to consider a stronger version of this result concerning a class of finite and infinite Henkin
structures that we call \textit{quasi-forests}. In this section, we give the definition of quasi-forest and we show how they can be combined into bigger quasi-forests using the notion of fusion from Section \ref{sec4}. Whenever quasi forests are finite, we simply call them \emph{finite
forests}. As a simple example, consider a finite tree and remove the root node, then it is no longer a finite tree. Instead it is a finite sequence of trees, whose roots stand in a linear (sibling)
order.\footnote{Note that, as far as roots are concerned, two
nodes can be siblings without sharing any parent. This would not
happen in a quasi tree.} It does not have a unique root, but it does have a
unique \emph{left-most root}. For technical reasons it will be convenient in the definition of quasi forests to add an extra monadic predicate  labeling the roots.

\begin{defi}[-quasi-forest]
Let  be a
-quasi-tree. Given a node  in , consider the -substructure of
 generated by the set , which is the set formed by 
together with all its siblings to the right and their descendants.
The -quasi-forest  is obtained by labeling each
root in this substructure with  (). Whenever  is a tree, we simply call  a
forest.
\end{defi}





We will show in our main proof of completeness that for each  and for each node  in a
definably well-founded -quasi-tree, the -quasi-forest  is --equivalent to a finite forest.
Our proof will use a notion of composition of -quasi-forests which is a special case of fusion.
Given a single node forest  and two -quasi-forests  and
, we construct a new -quasi-forest  by letting
the unique element in  be the left-most root, the roots of  become the children of this node and the roots of  become its siblings to the right. We then derive a corollary of the -fusion theorem for compositions of -quasi-forests and use it in Section \ref{sectproof}.

\begin{defi}
Let , be a relational vocabulary with only monadic predicates except  and . Given three
additional monadic predicates , we define a mapping  from  to quantifier-free formulas over  by letting
\begin{iteMize}{}
\item   
 \item  
 \item  
\item   
\end{iteMize}
\end{defi}
\begin{cor}
Let  be a single node forest and ,  -quasi forests. If  and  then
.
\end{cor}

Figure \ref{jolidessin} represents a composition of three forests , ,  which uses the mapping . Only new -arrows are represented, linking the unique node in  to the root nodes in . But new -links have also been added and the roots in  have became the siblings to the right of the root in . This is implicitly indicated by the left to right organization of the picture. 






\subsection{Main Proof of Completeness}
\label{sectproof}


\begin{lem}
  For all , every definably well-founded -quasi-tree of
  finite signature is --equivalent to a finite tree. In particular,
  a -sentence is valid on definably well-founded -quasi-trees iff it is
  valid on finite trees.
\label{lemma3}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Let  be a -quasi-tree, without loss of generality assume that a monadic predicate  labels its root (and only that node in the tree). During this proof, it will be convenient to work with
  -quasi-forests. Note that finite -quasi-forests
  are simply finite forests and finite -quasi-trees are
  simply finite trees (cf.~Proposition~\ref{prop:define-finite} for
  the case of quasi-trees, from which the case for quasi-forests
  follows immediately). Let  be the set of all nodes  of  for
  which it holds that  is --equivalent to a finite
  forest. We first show that `belonging to '' is a property definable in  (Claim ).
  We then use the induction scheme to show that every node of a definably well-founded -quasi-tree (so in particular, the root) has this property (Claim ).
  \medskip\par\noindent\emph{Claim 1:}
     is invariant for --equivalence (i.e.,
     implies that  iff ), and
    hence is defined by a -formula of
    quantifier depth .


  \begin{proofofclaim}
    Suppose that .
    We will show that , and hence, by the
    definition of ,  iff .
     By the definition of -quasi-forests, . Let  be any -sentence of quantifier depth . We can assume without loss of generality that  does not contain the variables  and  (otherwise we can rename in  these two variables). By lemma \ref{rel},  iff .
    Notice that  expresses precisely that 
    holds in  within the subforest . Moreover, the quantifier depth of
     is at most . It follows that 
    iff , and hence  iff
    .

    For the second part of the claim, note that by Lemma \ref{finitenesslemma}, up to logical equivalence, there are only
    finitely many -formulas of any given quantifier depth,
    as the vocabulary is finite.
  \end{proofofclaim}



  \smallskip\par\noindent\emph{Claim 2:} If all descendants and siblings
  to the right of  belong to , then  itself
  belongs to .

  \begin{proofofclaim}
    Let us consider the case where  has both a
    descendant and a following sibling (all other cases are
    simpler). Then, by axioms T3, T5, T8, T9 and T10,  has a first child , and
    an immediate next sibling . Moreover, we know that both  and
     are in . In other words,  and  are
    --equivalent to finite forests  and . Now, we
    construct a finite -quasi-forest  by taking a -fusion of ,  and of the -substructure of  generated by , whose unique element becomes a
    common parent of all roots of  and a left sibling of all
    roots of . So we get ).
    It is not hard to see that  is again a finite
    forest. Moreover, by the fusion theorem,
    .
    Now to show that  is isomorphic to  (which entails  i.e.  is --equivalent to a finite forest),
    it is enough to show . It holds that  because we can define in  each such union of sets by means
    of a disjunction. Now to show , take , so  for some . As ,
     and  are all definable in , the intersection of each of these sets with  is also definable in  and hence 
     is definable in ,  is definable in  and 
     is definable in . But then , which can be formed as the union of these three sets, is also definable in .
    
    \end{proofofclaim}

  It follows from these two claims, by the induction scheme for
  definable properties, that  contains all nodes of the -quasi-tree,
  including the root, and hence  is --equivalent to a finite
  tree (to a finite forest actually, but the root of the -quasi-tree being labeled by , it can also be viewed as a  -quasi-forest).
  For the second statement of the lemma, it suffices to
  note that every -sentence has a finite vocabulary and a finite
  quantifier depth.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:L-completeness}
  Let . The -theory of finite trees is completely axiomatized by .
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Theorem~\ref{thm:L-completeness} follows directly from Lemma \ref{lemma3} and Corollary \ref{henktreecomp}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Definability of the Class of Finite Trees}
\label{sec53}

Proposition \ref{tcdeftree} below shows together with Theorem~\ref{thm:L-completeness} that on standard structures, the set of  consequences actually defines the (not \fo-definable) class of finite trees. That is,  has \emph{no infinite standard model} at all.

\begin{prop}[\cite{2006}]
Let . On standard structures, there is a -formula which defines the class of finite trees.
\label{tcdeftree}
\end{prop}
\proof[Sketch of the proof]
It is enough to show it for . It follows by Section \ref{exppow} that it also holds for \mso and \folfp.
We merely give a sketch of the proof. For additional details we
refer the reader to \cite{2006}. 

Recall from Proposition~\ref{prop:define-finite} that, on finite standard
structures, the finite conjunction of the axioms T1--T10 in
Figure~\ref{fig:tree-axioms} defines the class of
finite trees, i.e., any finite structure satisfying this
conjunction is a finite tree. Now we will explain how to construct
another sentence, which together with this one, actually defines
on arbitrary standard structures the class of finite trees. Let
 be a shorthand for the formula labeling the leaves in the
tree () and  a
shorthand for the formula labeling the root (). Consider the
depth-first left-to-right ordering of nodes in a tree and the
\fotc formula  saying ``the node that comes after
 in this ordering is '':
\begin{center}

\end{center}
There is also a \fotc formula which says that ``x is the very last
node in this ordering''.  can be combined with this
formula into an  formula  expressing that the tree is
finite by saying that (we rely here for the interpretation of
 on the alternative semantics for the  operator given in
Proposition \ref{tcaltsem}) ``there is a finite sequence of nodes
 such that  is the root,  the node
that comes after  in the above ordering, for all , and
 is the very last node of the tree in the above ordering''.



\begin{thm}\label{thm:define}
For , the set of axioms T1--T10 together
with all -instances of the induction scheme Ind defines the
class of finite trees.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{tcdeftree} we can express in  by means of some formula  that a structure is a finite tree. So 
is provable in  (as it is a -formula
valid on the class of finite trees). In other words, if  is
the set of axioms T1--T10 together
with all -instances of the induction scheme Ind, then we have 
that .
\end{proof}


\section{Finite Linear Orders}
\label{secisftseclo}

Let us note that a simplified version of this method can be used in order to show the completeness of \mso, \fotc and \folfp on finite node-labeled linear orders (i.e., finite node-labeled trees in which every node has at most one child). The relevant simpler axioms are the ones listed in Figures \ref{fig:FO-axioms}, \ref{fig:lo-axioms} and respectively, Figures \ref{fig:MSO-axioms}, \ref{fig:fotc-axioms} and \ref{fig:folfp-axioms}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclmso}

In this paper, taking inspiration from Kees Doets \cite{1987} we developed a uniform method for obtaining complete axiomatizations of fragments of \mso on finite trees. For that purpose, we had to adapt classical tools and notions from finite model theory to the specificities of Henkin semantics. The presence of admissible subsets called for some refinements in model theoretic constructions such as formation of substructure or disjoint union. Also, we noticed that not every Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{\i}ss\'e game that has been used for \fotc was suitable to use on Henkin-structures. We focused on a game which does not seem to have been used previously in the literature. We also established analogues of the \fo Feferman-Vaught theorem for \mso, \fotc and \folfp on Henkin-structures (let us recall that related work for the case of standard structures can be found in \cite{2004}). We considered fusions, a particular case of the Feferman-Vaught notion of generalized product and obtained results for Henkin-structures which might be interesting to generalize and use in other contexts.

We applied our method to \mso, \fotc and \folfp, but it would be worth also examining other fragments of \mso or logics such as monadic deterministic transitive closure logic (\fodtc, which was advocated in \cite{1219706} as particularly relevant in the context of applications to model-theoretic syntax) or monadic alternating transitive closure logic (\foatc), see also \cite{1992}.


An important feature of our main completeness argument (the idea of which was borrowed from Kees Doets) is the way we used the inductive scheme of Figure \ref{fig:tree-axioms}. Hence, extending our approach to another class of finite structures would involve finding a comparable scheme. We also know that we should focus on a logic which is decidable on this class, as on finite structures recursive enumerability is equivalent to decidability (as long as the model-checking is decidable). This suggests that other natural candidates would be fragments of \mso on classes of finite structures with bounded treewidth.

Finally, let us notice that \mso is also known to be decidable over infinite trees and over linear orders of order type . It would be interesting to look for a model-theoretic argument which would work on a Henkin model and produce an intended model of one of these theories in a way comparable to what we did here or to what Keisler did in \cite{keisler}.
Note that related complete axiomatizations of monadic theories of classes of infinite structures can be found in \cite{siefkesbuchi},  \cite{siefkes} and \cite{zaiontz}, but that instead of relying on Henkin-semantics, the completeness proofs there are based on automata-theoretic techniques.
