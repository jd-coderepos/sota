Developing automatic Math Word Problem (MWP) solvers has been an interest of NLP researchers since the 1960s.
Over the last few years, there are a growing number of datasets and deep learning-based methods proposed for effectively solving MWPs. 
However, most existing methods are benchmarked solely on one or two datasets, varying in different configurations, which leads to a lack of unified, standardized, fair, and comprehensive comparison between methods. 
This paper presents \texttt{MWPToolkit}, the first open-source framework for solving MWPs. 
In \texttt{MWPToolkit}, we decompose the procedure of existing MWP solvers into multiple core components and decouple their models into highly reusable modules. 
We also provide a hyper-parameter search function to boost the performance. 
In total, we implement and compare 17 MWP solvers on 4 widely-used single equation generation benchmarks and 2 multiple equations generation benchmarks. 
These features enable our \texttt{MWPToolkit} to be suitable for researchers to reproduce advanced baseline models and develop new MWP solvers quickly.

\section{Introduction}


Developing automatic Math Word Problems (MWPs) solvers has been an interest of NLP researchers since the 1960s~\cite{feigenbaum1963computers, bobrow1964natural}. 
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:example}, when solving a MWP, machines need to make inferences based on the given textual problem description and question. 
It requires machines to translate the natural language text into valid and solvable equations according to context, numbers, and unknown variables in the text and then compute to obtain the numerical values as the answer.

\textbf{Single Equation Generation}:

 \textbf{Multiple Equations Generation}: 
 
 Jerome bought 12 CDs. Some cost 7.50\7.5 \times x+6.5 \times y=82, x+y=12x=4, y=8kkk\mapsto\mapsto\mapsto\mapsto<bridge>01e-510kkk<bridge>$ to convert equation forest to a tree for the multiple equations generation task. 
Hence it can be treated as the single equation generation task. 
We apply the 17 models on two multiple equation generation datasets, i.e., DRAW1K and HMWP. Their results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:multiple}. 
As we can observe in table~\ref{tab:multiple}, to our surprise, LSTMVAE achieves the best performance on Draw1K, and GPT-2 achieves the best performance on HMWP. 
Most researchers focus on improving performance on the single equation generation task, while few researchers develop models on the multiple equation generation task in the MWP solving community. 
We hope the results shown in table~\ref{tab:multiple} can help researchers develop more powerful and effective models for solving MWPs with multiple equations as their generation targets. 


\section{Related Work}

In NLP community, there have been a number of toolkits that managed to summarize the existing methods and establish a unified framework for a certain task, such as OpenNMT~\cite{klein2017opennmt} and TexBox~\cite{li2021textbox} for text generation tasks, ExplainaBoard~\cite{liu2021explainaboard} for evaluating interpretable models, Photon~\cite{zeng2020photon} for text-to-SQL tasks, and Huggingface's Transformers~\cite{wolf2020transformers} for model pretraining. 
To our best knowledge, there is no such a unified and comprehensive framework for MWPs solving task.
Therefore, we release \texttt{MWPToolkit}, which includes a considerable number of benchmark  datasets and deep learning-based solvers. 

Recently, a large number of new MWP solving methods have been proposed, including graph neural networks based ~\cite{li2020graph2tree}, template based~\cite{lee2021template}, neural symbolic~\cite{qin2021symbolic}, pre-trained based~\cite{liang2021mwp}, multilingual pre-trained based methods~\cite{tan2021multilingual}, and solvers using external information and signals~\cite{liang2021teacher, wu2021nums2t}. In addition, weakly supervised learning for MWP solving~\cite{hong2021lbf, chatterjee2021weakly} and supervised learning for geometric problem solving~\cite{lu2021gps, chen2021geoqa} have recently attracted much researchers' attention. More work on math word and geometric problem solving can be found in the survey paper~\cite{zhang2019mwpsurvey}. We will update more above methods to the toolkit in the future.


\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented an extensible, modularized, and easy-to-use toolkit, \texttt{MWPToolkit}, the first open-source framework for solving MWPs. 
In our \texttt{MWPToolkit}, we decompose the procedure of existing MWP methods into multiple components and decouple their models into highly reusable modules. 
We also provide a hyper-parameter search function for a fairer comparison. 
Furthermore, we implement and compare 17 MWP solving models, including Seq2Seq, Seq2tree, Graph2Tree, and commonly-used non-pretrained models and pretrained models, on 4 widely-used single equation generation benchmark datasets and 2 multiple equations generation benchmarks. These features enable our \texttt{MWPToolkit} to be suitable for researchers to reproduce reliable baseline models and develop new MWP solving methods quickly.

In the future, we will continue to add more benchmark datasets, the latest published MWP solvers, and commonly-used models into \texttt{MWPToolkit} as the regular update. We welcome more researchers and engineers to join, develop, maintain, and improve this toolkit to push forward the development of the research on MWPs solving.
