\begin{abstract}
An \itbf{indeterminate string}
 on an alphabet 
is a sequence of nonempty subsets of ;
\s{x} is said to be \itbf{regular} if every subset is of size one.
A proper substring \s{u} of regular \s{x} is said to be a \itbf{cover} of \s{x}
iff for every ,
an occurrence of \s{u} in \s{x} includes .
The \itbf{cover array}  of \s{x}
is an integer array such that  is the longest cover
of .
Fifteen years ago a complex, though nevertheless linear-time, algorithm
was proposed to compute the cover array of regular \s{x}
based on prior computation of the border array of \s{x}.
In this paper we first describe a linear-time algorithm
to compute the cover array of regular \s{x} based on the prefix table of \s{x}.
We then extend this result to indeterminate strings.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sect-intro}
The idea of a \itbf{quasiperiod} or \itbf{cover} of a string \s{x}
was introduced almost a quarter-century ago by
Apostolico \& Ehrenfeucht \cite{AE90}:
a proper substring \s{u} of \s{x} such that every position in \s{x}
lies within an occurrence of \s{u}.
Thus, for example,  is a cover of
.
In \cite{AFI91} a linear-time algorithm was described
to compute the shortest cover of \s{x};
this contribution was followed by linear-time algorithms to compute

\begin{itemize}
\item[]
the shortest cover of every prefix of \s{x} \cite{B92};
\item[]
all the covers of \s{x} \cite{MS94,MS95};
\item[]
all the covers of every prefix of \s{x} \cite{LS02}.
\end{itemize}

A \itbf{border} of a string \s{x} is a possibly empty
proper prefix of \s{x} that is also a suffix of \s{x}.
(Thus a cover of \s{x} is necessarily also a border of \s{x}.)
In the \itbf{border array} 
of the string ,
 is the length of the longest border of .
Since for , 
is the length of a border of \s{x} as well as
the length of the longest border of 
\cite{AHU74,S03},
it follows that  provides all the borders
of every prefix of \s{x}.
For example:



As shown in \cite{LS02}, the \itbf{cover array} \s{\gamma}
has a similar cascading property, giving the lengths
of all the covers of every prefix of \s{x} in a compact form:

 

Here  has covers 
and ,
while the entire string \s{x} has cover \s{u_2}.
The main result of \cite{LS02} is an algorithm that computes
 from 
in  time, while making no reference
to the underlying string \s{x}.

The results outlined above all apply to a \itbf{regular string} --- that
is, a string \s{x} such that each entry  is constrained to be a one-element
subset of a given set  called the \itbf{alphabet}.
In this paper we show how to extend these ideas and algorithms
to an \itbf{indeterminate string} \s{x} --- that is,
such that each  can be any nonempty subset of .
Observe that every regular string is indeterminate.

The idea of an indeterminate string was first introduced in
\cite{FP74}, then studied further in the 1980s as a ``generalized string''
\cite{A87}.
Over the last 15 years Blanchet-Sadri has written
numerous papers on the properties of ``strings with holes''
(each  is either a one-element subset of 
or  itself),
together with a monograph on the subject \cite{BS07};
while other authors have studied indeterminate strings
in their full generality, together with related algorithms
\cite{BRS09,NRR12,HS03,HSW08,SW08,SW09a,SW09,CRSW13}.
In the specific context of this paper, Vor\'{a}\v{c}ek \& Melichar \cite{VM05}
have done pioneering work on the computation of covers and related structures
in generalized strings using finite automata.

For indeterminate strings, equality of letters
is replaced by the idea of a ``match'' \cite{HS03}:
 \itbf{matches} 
(written ) if and only if
,
while  if and only if
 and corresponding positions in
\s{x} and \s{y} all match.
It is important to note that matching is nontransitive:
, but .

It is \cite{CRSW13} that provides the point of departure for our contribution,
as we now explain.
The \itbf{prefix table}  of  is an
integer array such that  and,
for every ,  is the length of the longest substring
occurring at position  of \s{x} that matches a prefix of \s{x}.
Thus, for our example (\ref{x}):

 

It turns out \cite{BKS13} that the prefix table and the border array
are ``equivalent'' for regular strings; that is,
each can be computed from \s{x} in linear time,
and each can be computed from the other,
without reference to \s{x}, also in linear time.
However, for indeterminate strings, this is not true:
the prefix table
continues to determine all the borders of every prefix of \s{x},
while the border array, due to the intransitivity of matching,
is no longer reliable in identifying borders shorter than the longest one.
Consider, for example:



Here \s{x} does not have a border of length ;
on the other hand,  correctly identifies
all the borders of every prefix of \s{x}.



Moreover, it was shown in \cite{CRSW13} that every \itbf{feasible} array --- that is,
every array  such that 
and for every ,  --- is a
prefix table of some (indeterminate) string.
Thus there exists a many-many correspondence between all possible
prefix tables and all possible indeterminate strings.
Furthermore, \cite{SW08} describes an algorithm to compute
the prefix table of any indeterminate string,
while \cite{ARS14} gives an algorithm to compute a
lexicographically least indeterminate string
corresponding to a given prefix table.

At this point let us discuss our motivation more precisely. First,
realize that to exploit the fullest functionality of a border array of an
indeterminate string we need to resort to the extended definition of the border
array which in fact requires quadratic space \cite{HS03,NRR12,BRS09}:
unlike the border array of a regular string, which is a simple array of
integers, the border array of an indeterminate string is an array of lists of
integers. Here at each position, the list gives all possible borders for that
prefix. On the other hand, the prefix array, even for the indeterminate string,
remains a simple one-dimensional array, just as for a regular string. It thus
becomes of interest to make use of the prefix table rather than the border array
whenever possible, in order to extend the scope of computations to indeterminate
strings.


In Section~\ref{sect-pcr} of this paper, we describe a linear-time
algorithm to compute the cover array \s{\gamma}
of a regular string \s{x} directly from its prefix table \s{\pi}. Then,
Section~\ref{sect-indet} describes a limited extension of this algorithm to
indeterminate strings.
Finally, Section~\ref{sect-future} outlines future research directions,
especially making use of prefix tables to extend the utility and applicability
of other data structures to indeterminate strings.

\section{Prefix-to-Cover for a Regular String}\label{sect-pcr}
In this section we describe our basic -time Algorithm  to
compute the cover array  of a regular string
 directly from its prefix table .
In fact, as noted in the Introduction, \s{\gamma} actually provides
all the covers of every prefix of \s{x}.
Central to our algorithm are the following definitions:

\begin{definition}\label{defn-range}
If, for a position , ,
then  is said to be
the \itbf{range} at  of \itbf{length} ;
the ranges  and , , are \itbf{connected}
if and only if .
\end{definition}
 
Notably, in what follows, for the sake of brevity, we may slightly abuse the
notation  by simply saying .

\begin{definition}\label{defn-live}
Position  in \s{\pi} is said to be \itbf{live} at position  if and only if
there exists a sequence of  connected ranges
, each of length at least , such that
.
Otherwise,  is said to be \itbf{dead} at .
\end{definition}

Thus  has a cover , , if and only if
 is live at  and the final connected range 
satisfies .

The strategy of Algorithm  (Figure~\ref{alg-pcr})
is to perform an on-line left-to-right scan of \s{\pi},
identifying connected ranges .
This process may be complex.
Within range  there may exist two (or more) positions  and 
that define ranges  and , both connected to ;
of these,  processes  first, followed by ,
then, if  and  are connected (they may not be),
by .
For example, consider\footnote{Thanks to Alice Heliou,

Here the pairs of ranges ,  and 
are all connected:
 will process positions 8--14 in ,
followed by 15--16 in , then 17--18 in 
and finally position 19 in .

\caption{Compute the cover array  of a regular string \s{x} from its prefix table .}
\label{alg-pcr}
\end{figure}

Algorithm  processes each connected range  twice,
first in left-to-right order,
beginning at position ,
where  is the current rightmost position for which 
has already been determined,
and ending at , the rightmost position in .
Corresponding to each  is the length  of the
prefix of  (hence also of \s{x}) that may extend a sequence of
covering substrings of length .
In order to determine whether or not  is live at ,
 maintains an array ,
using the following values:



However, it can happen that  and \s{\gamma} are not correctly set
by the left-to-right scan of :

\begin{definition}[\cite{LS02}]
\label{defn-ancestor}
In the cover array \s{\gamma},
if there exists an integer  and positions 
such that ,
then  is said to be the \itbf{ ancestor} of  in \s{\gamma}.
Thus the cover array determines a \itbf{cover tree}.
\end{definition}

It may be that  is set to zero because  is dead at ,
even though an ancestor of  in the cover tree is live at ;
on the other hand, when ,
so that ancestors of  may also be live at ,
the  values of the ancestors may need to be adjusted.
Thus a second right-to-left scan of  is required,
in order to ensure that these updates are correct.

For example, in (\ref{alice}),
we need to ensure that ,
since both 5 and 3 are live ancestors of 7.
A more subtle example is given in (\ref{alice'}),
where at position 19 we need to recognize that both 5 and 3 are live,
even though 7 is dead,
so that later, at position 22, we can recognize that 3 is live:

 

Consider also




Thus, using  additional words of storage and a double scan of each connected range,
Algorithm  is able to compute .
The time requirement is  plus the time required by the internal \bwhile loop;
this loop updates  at most once for each ancestral position  in the range,
thus requiring a total  time overall. Hence we have the following result:

\begin{theorem}
Given the prefix table  of a regular string ,
Algorithm  correctly computes the cover array  of \s{x}
in  time using an additional  integers of space.

\section{Extensions to Indeterminate Strings}
\label{sect-indet}
It turns out that for indeterminate strings there are
two natural analogues of the idea of ``cover''.

\begin{definition}
\label{defn-sliding}
A string  is said to have a \itbf{sliding cover}
of length 
if and only if
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
\s{x} has a suffix \s{v} of length ; and
\item[(b)]
\s{x} has a proper prefix \s{u}, ,
with suffix ; and
\item[(c)]
either  or else \s{u} has a cover of length .
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

A sliding cover requires that adjacent or overlapping substrings of \s{x}
match, but the nontransitivity of matching leaves open the possibility
that nonadjacent elements of the cover do not match.
For example,

has a sliding cover of length  because ,
even though .

However, note that the very concept of ``regularity of a string" in some
sense breaks down when we consider the concept of a sliding cover: now the
``cover" need not actually ``match" the area it is covering. In fact, the above
concept even allows for a string to be a cover of an indeterminate string
without being a substring of the latter at all! This motivates the idea of a
\itbf{rooted cover} of length , where every covering substring is
required to match, not the preceding entry in the cover, but rather the prefix
of \s{x} of length .
A rooted cover is defined simply by changing ``suffix'' to ``prefix''
in part (b) of Definition~\ref{defn-sliding}.
The example string (\ref{x'}) has no rooted cover,
but the string 
has both a sliding cover and a rooted cover of length 2. Notably, in the
literature, the concept of rooted cover is in fact used as the cover for an
indeterminate string \cite{BRS09}.




\subsection{Computing Rooted Covers}
In this section we describe Algorithm  (Fig. \ref{algo-position-array})
to compute  the set of rooted covers  of a given indeterminate string
 directly from its prefix table. As will be shown
below, the algorithm runs in linear time on average and  time in the
worst case.

Algorithm  maintains a list  to store the candidate rooted
covers. The algorithm also maintains an auxiliary  push-down store , which stores the list of dead covers at each iteration .  The
push-down store  will be used for marking the dead covers so as to
delete them at the end of each iteration. Lastly, in order to determine whether
or not the cover of length  is live at position , the algorithm maintains
an array  the same as in Algorithm .

\EndFor
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Compute all rooted covers of indeterminate string from its prefix
array.}
\label{algo-position-array}
\end{figure}

Exploiting the fact that the rooted cover of an
indeterminate string \s{x} is also a border of it, the algorithm
starts by identifying the set of candidate (rooted) covers as defined below.
 
\begin{definition}
Let  and let  be its prefix array. Then the
set of candidate (rooted) covers  of the whole string  is:


\end{definition}

To populate the list of candidate covers, we start by computing the value
. Then the algorithm initializes the list  with the filtered entries from the set , such that  will only store the values that satisfies  for .


During the execution of the main \bfor loop, at each position .
The algorithm tests, for each candidate cover  in list , whether
or not  is active.
Based on the result of this test the algorithm appropriately updates the
corresponding entry in the  array and marks the dead covers at position
, by storing those in  which will be
deleted at the end of each iteration using a \bwhile loop.

After computing the array  (at the end of the main \bfor loop), we can
easily identify and report the set of rooted covers of the whole string 
simply by finding all the entries in the array  that have the value 
(i.e., all entries of the list of candidate covers that are still active).

A final note regarding the use of the push-down store  is in
order. The standard approach, when the programming
language in use allows it, is to delete some elements from a list while iterating through it.
This can be done either: (1) by iterating backwards through the list and then
deleting within the \bfor loop, or (2) by identifying all items that need
to be deleted and marking them with a flag (in the first iteration), then (in
the second iteration) removing all those items which are flagged for
deletion. However, in  both cases (1) and (2), the algorithm must loop
through all the items in the list  after each iteration.
Alternatively, keeping track of the items to remove in another list (e.g.,
in ) and then, after all items have been processed, enumerating the
remove list () and removing each item from the list of candidate
covers () requires only looping through . 

\subsection{Analysis}
Finding the value  in  can be done with a simple linear
scan of the array . Computing the list  of candidate covers can be
done in  time. The main \bfor loop will be executed exactly  times.

Within the loop the checking of the condition whether a cover is active or not
can be done in constant
time for a particular value and hence the total testing of  or  for
all candidate covers requires time proportional to , which is
 in the worst case. Note that the list  tends to get smaller
and smaller as the iteration continues, because we keep removing dead covers
from it after each iteration. However, the complexity remains  in the
worst case (e.g., ).

Turning our attention to the \bwhile loop at the end of each iteration of
the main \bfor loop, the processing of  to remove the dead
covers also requires time proportional to
, thus  in the worst case since the total number of
covers is bounded by . We conclude that the worst-case time requirement
for the main \bfor loop is . The
final \bfor loop to report the list of rooted covers requires
time proportional to  which is .
The algorithm requires linear extra space to store the lists
,  and . So we have the following result:

\begin{theorem}
Given the prefix table  of an indeterminate string , Algorithm  correctly computes the set of rooted covers
of the whole string of \s{x} in  time and  linear space.
\end{theorem} 

Finally, Bari et. al. \cite{BRS09} proved that the expected number
of borders of an indeterminate string is bounded by a constant.
Since, in the beginning of Algorithm  we include only the borders in
, this means that the size of the list  and also
 is bounded by a constant. Therefore, based on the analysis
presented above we can conclude that Algorithm  runs in linear time
on average.

\subsection{An Illustrative Example}
Suppose .
We have . The simulation of the algorithm is shown in Fig.
\ref{PCInd-ex}. The algorithm initializes the set  with the set of 
candidate covers. Hence, we have . At iteration 
, we can see that cover  becomes non-active, so the value 
is set to  and the cover  is removed from the set of candidate covers.
Similarly, at iteration , the cover  becomes
non-active, so the value  is set to  and the cover  is
removed from the set of candidate covers. After computing the array ,
the list of rooted covers can be identified as all the positions  in
 where . So the covers are  and  since
 and . We have .

\subsection{The experiment}
To get an idea of how the algorithm behaves in practice, we have
implemented Algorithm  and conducted a simple experimental study. The
experiments have been carried out on a Windows Server
2008 R2 64-bit Operating System, with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 2600 processor @
3.40GHz having an installed memory (RAM) of 8.00 GB. The algorithm have
been implemented in  language using Visual Studio 2010.

  \caption{The average running time of the Algorithm .}
  \label{exp} 
\end{figure} 

We have run Algorithm  on a set of  randomly  generated prefix
arrays for each length  (averaged over 
runs for each length) and counted the average number of executions of the inner
loop of the algorithm. The resulting graph (Fig. \ref{exp}) shows the average
complexity of Algorithm  fluctuating around . Note that the values
 in the graph are scaled down by  (i.e., the curves are showing
) to have a better view of the curves. The results show that the
run time of the algorithm is close to linear confirming the average case time
complexity of .

\section{Future Directions}\label{sect-future}
There are several data structures related to the cover array
whose computation may now be contemplated in the context of
indeterminate strings.
For example, a recent paper \cite{FIKPPST13} introduces new forms
of ``enhanced'' cover array that are efficiently computed using the border array;
using the cover array instead would open the way for computation of variants
of these structures also for indeterminate strings.
Similarly, another recent paper \cite{CCIKPRRSW11} proposes efficient
algorithms for the computation of ``seed'' arrays
(a \itbf{seed} of a string \s{x} is a cover of some superstring of \s{x}) --- these
algorithms also may be similarly extended.
