\begin{abstract}
Ludics is a reconstruction of logic with interaction as a primitive notion, in the sense
that the primary logical concepts are no more formulas and proofs but cut-elimination
interpreted as an interaction between objects called designs.
When the interaction between two designs goes well, such two designs are said to be orthogonal.
A behaviour is a set of designs closed under bi-orthogonality.
Logical formulas are then denoted by behaviours. Finally proofs are interpreted as designs satisfying particular properties.
In that way, designs are more general than proofs and we may notice in particular that they are not typed objects.
{\em Incarnation} is introduced by Girard in Ludics as a characterization of ``useful'' designs in a behaviour. 
The incarnation of a design is defined as its subdesign that is the smallest one in the behaviour ordered by inclusion. 
It is useful in particular because being ``incarnated'' is one of the conditions for a design to denote a proof of a formula.
The computation of incarnation is important also as it gives a minimal denotation for a formula, and more generally for a behaviour. 
We give here a {\em constructive} way to capture the incarnation of the behaviour of a set of designs, without computing the behaviour itself. 
The method we follow uses an alternative definition of designs: rather than defining them as sets of chronicles, we consider them as sets of {\em paths}, a concept very close to that of play in game semantics that allows an easier handling of the interaction: the unfolding of interaction is a path common to two interacting designs.

\section{Introduction}
\Rouge{
\subsection{Ludics: a theory of Logic based on interaction} The cut elimination procedure is one of the main facts of Proof Theory, as it corresponds to a notion of computation in computer science, the one used in functional programming. In Ludics, the logical theory that J.-Y. Girard developed in~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01}, the cut elimination moved from a central position towards a primitive one: technically, the {\it cut} is no more a formal rule, \ie, one of the elementary constructors of formal proofs; the cut-rule disappears, instead of which a notion of {\em interaction} arises which happens between cut-free proof-like objects called {\it designs}. A design is a forest with {\em actions} as nodes, where an action is an abstract view of an application of a rule. An interaction is a travel through two such forests. Two designs are said {\it orthogonal} when interaction terminates.

Such an approach resting on interaction has strong relations with the Geometry of Interaction project~\cite{DBLP:conf/colog/Girard88,towards} which aims at studying cut-elimination as an interaction between proofs seen as operators. As in Geometry of Interaction, the process of cut-elimination happens in Ludics between objects that are more general than proofs.

Interaction between designs may also be understood as normalization in -calculus. As described by Terui~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Terui11}, a design corresponds to a generalized untyped -term in which the abstraction/application duality appears as several -ary abstraction/applications dualities.

\subsection{Ludics and Game Semantics} The approach developed in Ludics is closely related to another approach of calculus developed around a notion of interaction: the one occurring between player strategies in a game. Since the 90's,  beginning with seminal works of Lafont and Streicher~\cite{DBLP:conf/lics/LafontS91}, Game Semantics has been extremely fruitful for studying various fragments of Linear Logic or Classical Logic  in order to obtain 
full completeness results, from the multiplicative fragment~\cite{HylandOng93, DBLP:journals/jsyml/AbramskyJ94, DBLP:conf/lics/Loader94, DBLP:conf/lics/DevarajanHPP99,DBLP:conf/lics/AbramskyM99,DBLP:conf/lics/Lamarche95}, to Linear and Classical logics~\cite{Laurent04, Laurent05a,DalLagoLaurent08a,Laurent10}.  Considering event structures as a basis for Game Semantics, Mellies~\cite{DBLP:conf/lics/Mellies05, DBLP:conf/lics/MelliesT07} was able to prove full completeness for Linear Logic using {\em asynchronous} games: a formula is interpreted as an asynchronous game, and there is a full correspondence between proofs and strategies satisfying particular conditions.
It has 
been noticed that the basic concepts of Ludics may be expressed in terms of Game Semantics~\cite{DBLPconf/csl/Faggian02, DBLP:conf/csl/CurienF05,  DBLP:journals/corr/abs-cs-0501039} (see also~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1104-0504} for a thorough presentation).
\begin{itemize}
\item an action is a {\em move}, the  abstraction of the application of a rule,
\item the sequence of actions used during interaction is a {\em play}, the cut-elimination steps,
\item a design is an {\em innocent strategy}, it is also a frame of a sequent calculus derivation.
\end{itemize}
However there is a fundamental difference between Game Semantics as it is generally used and Ludics.
Strategies are typed, while designs are {\it a priori} untyped.
More concretely, a game comes with a set of {\em plays}, \ie, sequences of {\em moves} that satisfy particular conditions, a {\em strategy} is nothing else but such a set of plays. In Ludics, a play is what results from the interaction between two designs, and 
 a game, what denotes a formula,
 is interpreted as a behaviour, \ie, a set of designs which is closed under bi-orthogonality. 
Notice that, considered as an element of a behaviour, only part of a design may be travelled during interactions with designs in the orthogonal of the behaviour, and this part has to be considered as a strategy in terms of Game Semantics.
In simple words, a behaviour constrains the use of a design, the design being viewed as a set of {\em potential} plays, hence only a {\em potential} strategy.


\subsection{Ludics: main results, new concepts} 

Starting from the sole notion of interaction, Ludics  defines new objects: 
designs which are completely defined by their interactions, as affirmed by the separation theorem~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01}. 
Then, once given objects of Ludics, it is possible to rebuild the logic. A formula is denoted by a {\em behaviour}; a proof of a formula is denoted by designs satisfying specific properties.
With this in mind, Ludics can be seen as a semantics of Linear Logic: (i) the meaning of a formula is a set of designs, (ii) a design may be viewed as abstracting a concrete, polarized and focalized proof (and taking into account infinity and failures). 
Besides the usual theorems (associativity, stability, ), two important properties are available within Ludics: internal and full completeness. Internal completeness results from the fact that the space of behaviours/formulas is fully describable in terms of multiplicative and additive connectives over behaviours/formulas.
Full completeness is obtained when one characterizes the correspondence between all proofs (of formulas) and specific designs (of behaviours\footnote{In fact behaviours together with a partial equivalence relation.}).
Ludics introduces also original additional concepts among which {\em locativity}, \ie, the replacement of a formula by its address. Making explicit locativity  plays an important role in recent versions of Geometry of Interaction~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Girard11}, \cite{DBLP:journals/apal/Seiller12}. Another original new concept of Ludics is {\em incarnation}, a central concept in this paper.
Incarnation is a characterization of ``useful'' designs in a behaviour , \ie, designs necessary for defining  with respect to orthogonality. To be ``incarnated'', or ``material'', is one of the conditions for a design to denote a proof of a formula. The incarnation  of a behaviour  is its set of incarnated designs, \ie, designs  such that , the incarnation  of a design  being defined as the smallest design included in  and belonging to .
The computation of incarnation is important as it gives a kind of minimal presentation of behaviours, and in particular of the denotation of a formula or a type. 
A behaviour being defined as the closure of a set of designs with respect to orthogonality, it could be useful to have a {\em constructive} way to capture its incarnation, without computing the behaviour itself, particularly when considering not yet closed models (of programs, processes, ...). 


\subsection{Our contribution}

Given a set  of designs of the same base, not necessarily closed under bi-orthogonality, our aim is to compute the incarnation of the behaviour generated by this set, without having to fully determine this behaviour. 
Such a computation is difficult in general:
some pieces may be found in designs of the behaviour that are not already present in , and the computation of the ones that are relevant with respect to incarnation does not seem simpler than computing the behaviour itself. 
The method we follow uses an alternative definition of designs: rather than using their original definition as sets of {\it chronicles}~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01}, 
we consider them as sets of {\em paths}, a concept very close to that of play in game semantics, that allows an easier handling of the interaction: the unfolding of an interaction is a path common to two interacting designs. 
Among the paths of a set of designs , we characterize those that are really visited during the interaction with , the orthogonal of . 
Hence a two-step process may be followed:
designs in the incarnation of  are built from particular maximal cliques of visitable paths and, these designs being computed, it remains to repeat the same operation for getting the incarnation of the behaviour generated by the set .

The rest of this article is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item In section~\ref{sec:Ludics}, we recall the original definitions of Ludics objects, in particular designs as cliques of chronicles and the interaction process.
\item In section~\ref{sec:Paths}, we define a notion of path together with a definition of coherence on paths. We present an equivalent definition of a design as a clique of paths. 
\item We characterize in section~\ref{section:normalization_visitable} those paths that are visitable by interaction.
\item In section~\ref{sec:Incarnation}, we focus on incarnation. We show that incarnation of the dual is obtained from particular maximal cliques of visitable paths, from which we obtain a double-step process for computing the incarnation of the behaviour generated by a set of designs. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic facts about Ludics}\label{sec:Ludics}
\subsection{Ludics: an informal introduction from a proof theoretical point of view} 
Ludics~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01} is a reconstruction of logic with {\em interaction} as a primitive notion, in the sense that the primary logical concepts  are no more formulas and proofs but cut-elimination interpreted as an interaction between objects called {\em designs}. 
The structure of a design may be introduced by considering the following questions concerning proof structure and cut-elimination: what is necessary to know about a proof when we are interested in its behaviour during the process of cut-elimination? Can such a proof-object be completely defined by this behaviour? 
Notice that the cut elimination process consists in travelling
along cut-proofs of formulas by passing through each of their rules from the conclusion of the rule towards
their premisses. Therefore, determining each possible cut elimination process for a given formula is closely related to the search of all possible proofs of this formula. Hence,
 the starting question may be formulated as follows: what are the relevant parts of a proof-object with respect to proof search?

As studied by Andreoli~\cite{DBLP:journals/logcom/Andreoli92}, Linear Logic sequent calculus admits a focalized presentation:
the proof search may be viewed as a recursive process alternating reversible (or asynchronous, negative) and non-reversible (or synchronous, positive) steps (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Polarities}). 
In such a bottom-up approach, as soon as there is a negative formula, \ie, a formula having as principal connective  or  in the conclusion, such a negative formula is decomposed until its positive subformulas, \ie, formulas with 
 or  as principal connective. Otherwise, if there are only positive formulas in the conclusion, one of these positive formulas is decomposed until its negative subformulas. As proved by Andreoli~\cite{DBLP:journals/logcom/Andreoli92}, this focusing discipline is complete with respect to provability.
Going one step further, a {\em hypersequentialized} version of multiplicative-additive Linear Logic sequent calculus may be defined~\cite{DBLP:journals/logcom/Andreoli92,girard00,DBLP:journals/iandc/CurienF12} with only  two kinds of logical rules (the positive and the negative) beside the axioms, one strictly alternating with the other.
Formulas  and rules of the hypersequentialized sequent calculus are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:HScalculus}.

 We give below examples of part of proofs in the hypersequentialized calculus. 

\begin{exa}
Let , , , ,  be negative formulas and  be a positive one, formulas  and  are positive. Their proofs in the hypersequentialized calculus begin in the following way:

The proof trees may also be represented by means of derivation trees where nodes are the rules involved in the proofs, noting  when it is a positive rule,   otherwise:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {}; 
\node at (0,.6) {};
\end{tikzpicture}
\hspace{.1cm}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {};
\node at (-2,1.2) {};
\node at (2,1) {};
\node at (2,2) {};
\node at (1,3.2) {};
\node at (3,3.2) {};
\draw (0,.3) -- (-2,.7);
\draw (0,.3) -- (2,.7);
\draw (2,1.3) -- (2,1.7);
\draw (2,2.3) -- (1,2.7);
\draw (2,2.3) -- (3,2.7);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\label{exa:proofs}
\end{exa}


\noindent Let us outline that such a hypersequentialized presentation of proof objects is relevant for  our starting question. It enables one to get rid of irrelevant  parts of proofs with respect to proof-search or equivalently  cut elimination. For example, suppose that ,  and  are negative linear formulas and that we are looking for a proof of  or for a proof of . We just need to find either some proofs of  and  or some proofs of  and . Equivalently in terms of cut-elimination, starting from a cut on   or on  , the process continues either with cuts on  and on , or with cuts on  and on . Hence the distinction between formulas  and   is not relevant. Furthermore, it is useless to consider subformulas  , , . What is relevant is to consider subformulas with opposite polarity, here ,  and . This is realized in hypersequentialized discipline, where we keep only one of the two equivalent formulas, \eg\ , and where the logical rule enables to go directly to subformulas ,  and .

A still more radical choice is then made in Ludics: instead of (canonical) formulas, only addresses are kept. A subformula has an address relatively to the occurrence of a formula in which it appears. Such an address is the {\em locus} on which an {\em interaction}, \ie, a cut, may take place. In terms of Ludics, a rule that decomposes a formula into subformulas is replaced by a rule applied to a locus that generates a finite number of subloci. 
A locus is presented as a finite sequence of integers. Subloci generated by applying a rule to a locus  are built by increasing the sequence  with arbitrary distinct integers. 

\begin{exa}
The two pieces of proofs in (classic) Linear Logic sequent calculus:\\
\begin{center}
  \shortstack{

                     }

                     \\
                     }

\noindent are both replaced in the hypersequentialized calculus by: 
                              \shortstack{
                     \shortstack{\\
                     }\hspace{2em}
                     \shortstack{\\
                     }\\
                     \\
                     }    \\
and are both replaced in Ludics by: 
                              \shortstack{
                     \shortstack{\\
                     }\hspace{2em}
                     \shortstack{\\
                     }\\
                     \\
                     }    
                     
                              
\label{loci}
\end{exa}
In the hypersequentialized calculus, one might expect that a proof search stops once it  arrives at an axiom. However in Ludics there are no more formulas, thus no more axioms. Obviously, there should exist a way to stop an interaction. Still using the proof search intuition, an interaction ends when one of the interacting designs gives up: this is expressed by means of a special rule in Ludics, called {\it daimon}.


Once the above generalization is performed, presenting designs as abstract proofs may remain ambiguous.
In fact, as it is the case in example~\ref{dessin}, two proof-like presentations of designs that only differ on the distribution of weakened contexts cannot be distinguished by interaction: it is not possible to find a counter-proof with which the result of the cut-elimination procedure would be distinct. 
In terms of Ludics, a rule is presented as an {\em action} of the form  where  are integers concatenated as suffixes to  in order to create subaddresses,
and designs are presented as trees (or more likely forests) where nodes are actions.

\begin{exa}
The two (complete) proof-like trees on the left are more likely represented by the tree of  actions on the right:

The object in Ludics is the following set of chronicles:

 The main object of Ludics, the {\bf design}, is defined by Girard~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01} as a set of pairwise coherent {\bf chronicles}, \ie\ a clique of chronicles, where chronicles are alternate sequences of {\bf actions}, the coherence relation being defined below. The actions themselves are built using a notion of {\bf locus}.
 
  \begin{defi}[Locus]
 A locus is a finite (maybe empty) sequence of integers.
  \end{defi}
\noindent{\sc Notation:} The loci  will be denoted by Greek letters: , , \dots If  is a finite set of integers, we denote  the set . 

 \begin{defi}[Action]
An {\bf action}  is
\begin{itemize}
\item either a positive proper action  or a negative proper action  where the locus  is said the {\em focus} of the action, and the finite set of integers  is said its {\em ramification},

\item or the positive action daimon denoted by .
\end{itemize}
 A locus  is {\em justified} by an action  when . By extension an action  is {\em justified} by an action  when , ,  and . 
\end{defi}

In~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01} chronicles are defined as follows:

\begin{defi}[Chronicle]
A {\bf chronicle}  is a non-empty and finite alternate sequence of actions such that
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Positive proper action:} A  positive proper action is either justified, \ie, its focus is built by one of the previous actions in the sequence, or it is called initial. 
\item {\em Negative action:} A negative action may be initial, in such a case it is the first action of the chronicle. Otherwise it is justified by the immediate previous positive action.
\item {\em Linearity:} Actions have distinct focuses.
\item {\em Daimon:} If present, a daimon ends the chronicle. 
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Coherence on Chronicles]
Two chronicles  and  are {\bf coherent}, noted , when the two following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Comparability:}  Either one extends the other or they first differ on negative actions, \ie, if  then either  or  and  are negative actions.
\item {\em Propagation:} When they first differ on negative actions and these negative actions have distinct focuses then the focuses of following actions in  and  are pairwise distinct, \ie, if  with  then  and  have distinct focuses.
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\noindent{\sc Notation:} An action is denoted ,  or even  where  is equal to  or , when we want to precise its polarity.  denotes a sequence of actions. A chronicle is denoted by , ,   or by  when we need to precise the actions occurring in the chronicle.\\

 
\begin{exa}~\\
\begin{minipage}{.66\textwidth}
To summarize, a chronicle is an alternate sequence of actions. A set of coherent chronicles may be presented as a tree (in fact, a forest when the first actions of chronicles are negative). Such a tree branches at negative nodes only and a branch is a chronicle. The tree on the right is a set of two coherent chronicles.

In order to be able to manipulate several chronicles together, it is convenient to consider chronicles with a given {\bf base}, \ie, a sequent of loci written  such that  is a finite set of  loci and  contains at most one locus and the loci belonging to  are pairwise disjoint, \ie, no locus is a sublocus of another one. When  is empty, the base is called positive, otherwise it is called negative.
A chronicle  is said {\bf based on}  provided that  contains the focus of the initial negative action of  if it exists (otherwise  is empty) and   contains the focuses of initial positive actions (so a finite number).
Note that coherence of chronicles does not rely on their bases. In fact,  the definition of the base of a chronicle is liberal: there is not a unique base for each chronicle but several ones. Suppose  is a base for a chronicle , and that , then  is also a base of .
We can observe that  must contain at least all the focuses of initial actions of  for  to be a base of . 
Nevertheless one may consider the coherence of two chronicles either when the base of the first one is included in the base of the second one, or when the two bases are disjoint. In this latter case, the only possibility of coherence is when the bases are negative ones.

 

\begin{defi}[Designs, Slices, Nets]~
  \begin{itemize}
\item[] A {\bf design} , based on
  , is a set of chronicles based on
  , such that the following conditions are
  satisfied:
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item  {\em Forest:} The set of chronicles is prefix closed.
\item  {\em Coherence:} The set is a clique of chronicles with respect to . 
\item {\em Positivity:} A chronicle without extension in  ends with a positive action.
\item {\em Totality:}  is non-empty when the base is positive, in that case all the chronicles begin with a (unique) positive action.
\end{itemize}
\item[]  A {\bf slice} is a design  such that if  then . 
\item[]  A {\bf net} is a finite set of designs on disjoint bases. 
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

A design may contain several chronicles ending with a negative action of same focus: this allows for representing the `with' `' additive connective of Linear Logic. A design may be split with respect to such situations to give rise to {\em slices}: a slice has a multiplicative structure.

\begin{exa}

\noindent A proof-like presentation of a design is given by the following notion of {\bf design as a dessin}:\medskip

\begin{defi}[Design as dessin]~
A design as dessin based on  is a tree of bases with root  and built by means of the following rules: 
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item {\sc Daimon}

\item {\sc Positive rule}

for , the  are pairwise disjoint and included in     .
\item {\sc Negative rule} 

 is a set  (maybe empty or infinite) of ramifications. For all  ,  the 's are not necessarily disjoint and are included in  . 
\end{itemize} 

\end{defi}

\noindent With a design based on , may be associated one or several proof-like presentations: a design as dessin of same base, with a positive rule for each positive action and a negative rule containing all the negative actions with the same focus. Nevertheless, such a presentation is not unique, as it is illustrated in the following example. 
\begin{exa} {\bf Designs and their proof-like presentation as dessins}\label{design-as-dessin}
\begin{itemize}
\item The design based on   which contains a unique chronicle, itself reduced to the action   is denoted . It has a unique proof-like presentation: 

\item The empty design based on   is denoted by . It has also a unique proof-like presentation: the tree reduced to the root  .
\item  The following design based on :
 
                        has several proof-like presentations, for example the two following ones:

\subsection{Interaction and Behaviours}

Interaction, \ie, cut elimination, is a normalization of particular nets of designs, called {\it cut-nets}~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01}. We give below the definition of interaction in the case of a closed cut-net, \ie, all addresses in bases are part of a cut. Therefore, one main design is distinguished because its base has no left part, \ie, is positive. 
The reader may find in~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01} the definition for the general case.

 
\begin{defi}[Closed cut-net]
Let  be a net of designs,  is a {\em closed cut-net} if 
\begin{itemize}
\item addresses in bases are either distinct or present twice, once in a left part of a base and once in a right part of another base,
\item the net of designs is acyclic and connex with respect to the graph of bases and cuts.
\end{itemize}
An address presents in a left part and in a right part defines a {\em cut}. 
\end{defi}

\begin{exa}\hfill
\begin{itemize}
\item A net of two designs of respective bases  and  forms a closed cut-net.
\item A net of two designs of respective bases  and  is not a closed cut-net: the graph of cuts is cyclic.
\item A net of three designs of respective bases , ,  is a closed cut-net.
\end{itemize}
\end{exa}
 
\begin{defi}[Interaction on closed cut-nets]
Let  be a closed cut-net. 
The design resulting from the interaction, denoted by , is defined in the following way:
let  be the main design of , with first action ,
\begin{itemize}
\item if  is a daimon, then ,
\item otherwise  is a proper positive action  such that  is part of a cut with another design with last rule  (aggregating ramifications of actions on the same focus ):
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If , then interaction fails.
	\item Otherwise, interaction follows with the connected part of subdesigns obtained from  with the rest of .
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\noindent Following this definition, either interaction fails, or it does not end, or it results in the design .
The definition of orthogonality follows:

\begin{defi}[Orthogonal, Behaviour]~
\begin{itemize}
\item Let  be a design of base  (resp. ), \\
let  be the net of designs  (resp. ), where  has base  and  has base , \\
 belongs to  if . 
\item Let  be a set of designs of the same base, .
\item  is a {\em behaviour} if .
A behaviour is {\em positive} (resp. {\em negative}) if the base of its designs is positive (resp. negative).
\end{itemize}

\section{Designs as sets of paths}\label{sec:Paths}



 We characterize in section~\ref{sec:Incarnation} incarnation of a set of designs  as particular cliques of {\em visitable paths in }. 
 A visitable path in a set of designs  is a sequence of actions  in a design  of  which are visited during a normalization with a net of designs of . A clique of such paths is a set of pairwise coherent set of paths, where the coherence relation defined in~\ref{defi:coherence_path} generalizes the one given for chronicles.
What is called in this paper a visitable path is a {\em play} in terms of Game Semantics. We should stress again the fact that designs are untyped objects: what is used by interaction in a design  depends on the set of designs in which  is considered. Concretely, it is possible to consider which designs are orthogonal to a given design  alone, or to a set of designs  that contains . Sequences of actions of  that are visited during interaction are not necessarily the same for the first case (orthogonals to the set containing  alone) or for the second case (orthogonals to each design of , hence also to ): the set (when closed under bi-orthogonality) in which  is considered gives the type. 
In section~\ref{section:normalization_visitable}, we call {\em normalization path} of a design  a sequence of actions which are visited by interaction with {\em some} net of designs, without taking care of the set in which we may consider the design : a normalization path may be viewed as a potential play in terms of Game Semantics.

The remainder of this section is devoted to a study of {\em paths based on a net}. The {\em base of a net} consists in the sets of loci that serve as initial addresses, hence initial actions of a design. Paths generalize normalization paths (and visitable paths) in that their definition do not take into account the dual aspect of a play as we notice below after having introduced the concept of view. In studies concerning Linear Logic and done by means of Game Semantics (\eg\ \cite{DBLP:conf/csl/FaggianH02,Laurent05a}), a play in a strategy is a sequence of actions that satisfies several conditions among which {\em visibility}. Visibility is one of the constraints that ensure that a play is a denotation of a cut-elimination process.
Visibility is defined by means of a {\em view} operation on sequences (present in Hyland and Ong-Nickau games~\cite{HylandOng93,DBLP:conf/lfcs/Nickau94}).   
The view allows to recover a chronicle from a sequence of actions, hence also from paths: a view is the subsequence obtained from some sequence of actions by jumping from a negative action to its justification, if any, that should be a positive action, and from a positive action to the action that immediately precedes.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:ExNegJump} on the left, the view of the sequence  is the dashed red sequence noted . Note that the concept of view derived from the one of play in Game Semantics has a primitive r\^ole in Ludics: a design is a set of chronicles and chronicles are the views of potential plays, of a potential innocent strategy. In other words, the concept of view is derived from the one of play in Game Sematics whereas the concept of path is derived from the one of chronicle in Ludics.
 

\begin{defi}[Base, Sequence, View]~
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\bf base of net}  is a non-empty finite set of sequents of pairwise disjoint loci: , \dots,
 such that each  contains exactly one locus , except at most one which may be empty, and the  are finite sets.
\item A sequence of actions  is {\bf based on } if an action of  either is hereditarily justified by an element of one of the sets  or , or is a daimon which is, in the later case, the last action of . 
An action is {\em initial} if it is an element of one of the sets  or .
\item Let  be a sequence of actions based on , the {\bf view}  is the subsequence of 
defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item  where  is the empty sequence;
\item ;
\item ;
\item  where  either is empty if  is initial or is the prefix of  ending with the positive action which justifies .
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\noindent Proponent and Opponent players, as coined in Game Semantics, arise naturally in Ludics from the fact that actions are polarized and polarity alternates in chronicles: with respect to a design , a positive action is played by Proponent whereas a negative action is played by Opponent. Opponent and Proponent are interchanged when considering an orthogonal to the design . 
A sequence of actions is {\em visible} if the justification of every Proponent action  is in the Proponent view of , this is called P-visitability, and dually, if the justification of every Opponent action  is in the Opponent view of  , called O-visitability. 
 A path, see Def.~\ref{defi:path}, is defined as an alternate, justified, linear, total sequence of actions that satisfies the P-visitability (Opponent being not already known).
We prove in section~\ref{section:normalization_visitable} that a normalization path is a path such that its dual is also a path: in other words the two facets of visibility are satisfied, \ie, P- and O-visitability.
The constraints (Totality) and (Daimon) are added to care of positive bases: in case the base contains a sequent , either the path is reduced to the daimon or it begins with a positive action focused on a locus of .

\begin{defi}[Path]\label{defi:path}
A {\bf path}  based on  is a finite sequence of
actions based on  such that
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Alternation:} The polarity of actions alternate between
positive and negative.
\item {\em Justification:} A proper action is either justified, \ie, its
focus is built by one of the previous actions in the sequence, or it is
called initial with a focus in one of  (resp. ) if
the action is negative (resp. positive).
\item {\em Negative jump:} (There is no jump on positive action) Let  be a subsequence of ,\\
- If   is a positive proper action justified by a negative
action  then .\\
- If   is an initial positive proper action then its focus belongs to
one   and either  is  the first action of 
and  is empty, or   is immediately preceded in
 by a negative action with a focus hereditarily justified by an element
of .
\item {\em Linearity:} Actions have distinct focuses.
\item {\em Daimon:} If present, a daimon ends the path. If it is the
first action in  then one of  is empty.
\item {\em Totality:} If there exists an empty , then  is non-empty and begins either with  or with a positive action with a focus in .
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\noindent In the remainder of the paper, we use an explicit formulation for the justifier of an action to precede it in the sequence (negative jump): Let  be a positive proper action justified by a negative
action , 

iff
there is a sequence
  beginning with
, ending with  and such that
 immediately precedes  in  and
 justifies .
Fig.~\ref{fig:ExNegJump} gives an example of a sequence that is not a path: the sequence  `jumps' from the negative action  in a chronicle to the positive action  that stays in another chronicle.
Remark also that the view  is not a chronicle. Proposition~\ref{chroniclebase} establishes that the view of a path is a chronicle, and we prove in proposition~\ref{prop:pathsTOnet} that views of a set of {\em pairwise coherent} paths define a net of designs.

A path is {\em positive} or {\em negative} with respect to the polarity of its last action. If  is a set of paths, we note  the subset of  consisting of positive paths, \ie, paths ending with a positive action.
Remark that a (non-empty in case the base is positive) prefix of a path is a path.
Remark also that a chronicle based on  is a path.
Before we establish how paths may be viewed as chronicles, a few more facts must be stated.

 \begin{lem}\label{projection}
Let  be a path based on , and  be a proper action occurring in . 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If  is initial and negative in  then it is the only initial negative action occurring in  and it is the first action of .
  \item  is initial in   iff it is  initial in .
  \item  is justified by  in  iff   is justified by  in .
  \end{itemize}
 \end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let us observe that by construction if  is a proper action occurring in  and if  is a prefix of  then  is a prefix of .
\begin{itemize}
\item If   is negative and initial in  then it is the first action of : we have  and . Hence it is unique.
\item By construction, if  is initial in  then it is initial in . 
Similarly, if  is justified by  in  then   is justified by  in .
\end{itemize}
We prove the converse of the two last properties by considering separately the two polarities of .
\begin{itemize}
\item If  is negative and justified  by  in  then, by construction,  is justified by  in . Hence if  is initial in , it should be initial in .
\item If  is positive and justified by a negative action  in  then there is a finite sequence 
   beginning with , ending with  and such that  immediately precedes  in  and  justifies . This means that the prefix  of   may be written 
 . Then 

 Hence  is justified by  in .
 Thus if  is initial in , then it should be initial in .
\end{itemize}
  \end{proof}


\begin{prop}\label{chroniclebase}
Let  be a non empty path based on , \dots,  . The sequence    is a chronicle based on  for some .
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Since  contains at least one action,  contains at least  where   is the last action of .
By construction  is alternate.  As a consequence of lemma~\ref{projection} the proper actions of  whose focuses are not in one of the bases (hence not initial in ) are justified in . And of course if present the daimon ends . Moreover, a negative action which is not initial is justified by the positive action which immediately precedes it in . Hence  is a chronicle.
We just have still to check that the chronicle  is based on one . This is done by induction on the length of .
\begin{itemize}
\item :\\
 Suppose that  is negative. It is initial, its focus is in one , then  is the chronicle  based on . 
 \\
 Suppose that  is positive. In such a case, there exists an empty  and either  or the focus of  is in . Thus  is a chronicle based on . 

  \item . By induction hypothesis, for each non-empty strict prefix  of , there exists  such that  is a chronicle based on a .\\
   Suppose that  is negative. If it is initial, its focus is in one ,  then  is the chronicle  based on .  Otherwise, by construction  is justified by the positive action  which immediately precedes  in . Let  be the prefix of  ending by . It is a strict non-empty prefix, hence there exists  such that  is a chronicle based on  and  is also a chronicle based on .\\
Suppose that  is positive. We have that  and  is a chronicle based on some . Note that  is a chronicle based on . So we suppose now that . If  is initial then  its focus  is one  and   the focus of  is hereditarily justified by an element of .  Hence  and   is a chronicle based on   . If  is justified by a negative action   then  and, by lemma~\ref{projection},  is in . Hence, as by induction  is a chronicle based on some , so is .
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\noindent In the following, we develop further on this idea and show in proposition~\ref{prop:pathsTOnet} that we can build in a unique way a net of designs from the views of a set of paths. For that purpose, we must consider the views of all {\em prefixes} of paths: each prefix may define a particular chronicle. Furthermore, not only such paths must obviously have the same base but they must also be pairwise {\em coherent}, where this coherence relation generalizes the notion of coherence given for chronicles.
 
\begin{defi}[Coherence on paths]\label{defi:coherence_path}
Two paths  and  on the same base are
coherent, noted , when: 
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item their first actions have same polarity: either positive and the first actions are the same or negative;
\item for all sequences  and   respectively prefixes of  and  :
\begin{itemize}[label=\quad]
\item if  then ;
\end{itemize}
\item for all sequences  and  , respectively prefixes of  and  , \\
let  be either the empty sequence if  is initial or the prefix of  ending by the justification of , \\
let  be either the empty sequence if  is initial or the prefix of  ending by the justification of ,
\begin{itemize}[label=\quad]
\item if  and  and  have distinct focuses
\item then for all actions  and  such that   and   are respectively prefixes of  and , and such that   and ,  and  have distinct focuses.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
To rephrase the last item,  and  satisfying the conditions,  and  should have distinct focuses if they are ulterior actions hereditarily justified by  and  respectively in  and .

\end{defi}

The relation  is reflexive. 
Note that, applied to chronicles, the notion of coherence on paths coincide with the notion of coherence on chronicles given by Girard~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01} and recalled in the previous section.
Hence, in the following, we only use the notation  to speak of coherence between paths or between chronicles.
Moreover, the comparability property in the definition of coherence between chronicles is still satisfied between coherent paths: if  then either one extends the other or they first differ on negative actions. 
In fact, if  and  are respective prefixes of  and   with , then the condition of coherence is not satisfied, hence .\bigskip


We show below that the union of views of prefixes of coherent paths such that maximal ones are positive forms a net of designs. Taking a unique path, we recover the fact that it gives rise to a net of slices.\bigskip

\noindent{\sc Notations}:\hfill
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item Let  be a non-empty path,  is the prefix closure of , \ie, the set of paths that are non-empty prefixes of . We put .
\item Let  be a set of paths of the same base,  and .
\item Let  be a pathh,  is noted
  . More generally,  is noted
  .
\end{itemize}


\begin{prop}\label{prop:pathsTOnet}
 Let  be a non empty set  of non empty coherent paths based   on   
such that maximal ones are positive and let  be its closure by prefixes. The set of chronicles  defined as the union of views of paths of  forms a net of designs based on . 
  \end{prop} 


 \begin{proof}
Let .
Let  be either an element of one of  or the focus of the first positive action of the paths of  (and in this case there exists  such that ). We consider the subset  of  defined in the following way: 
 
 We consider the set of chronicles defined by  .
Suppose  is not empty. We know by proposition \ref{chroniclebase} that there exists  such that these chronicles are all based on , and either  is empty and  or .
 Then  we check that  is a design based on :
\begin{itemize}
\item (Forest) Suppose that  and let  be a non empty prefix of . As , there is a path  belonging to  and a prefix   of , belonging to , such that . The last action  of  belongs to . 
If  is the daimon, then it is the last action of , hence .
Otherwise,  is a proper action occurring in , hence in , thus there exists  and  is a prefix of . We already observed that in that case  is a prefix of  ending with . Hence  belongs to . 

\item (Coherence) Suppose that  and  belong to . This means that there are two paths  and , belonging to , and two prefixes  and  of respectively  and , belonging to , such that  for . 
Let us note  and
.
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item If  and  are positive then  for , hence . Thus, as  and   are coherent, .
\item If  and  are negative with distinct focuses  then all the ulterior actions  and  hereditarely justified by  and  respectively in  and   have distinct focuses; then it is still true in  and , \ie, if   and   are initial sequences respectively of  and  and are such that   and , then
 and  have distinct focuses. 
\end{itemize}

\item (Positivity) By construction since the maximal paths in  are positive ones, chronicles in  without extension end with a positive action.

\item (Totality) It follows from the Totality constraint on paths.
\end{itemize}
Note that sets  are either empty or designs with disjoint sequents as bases. Hence the result.
\end{proof}
 



 
We know how to reconstruct some designs or nets of designs from cliques of paths. In fact a net of designs  based on  may be recovered from the set of {\em paths on }, that is to say paths  based on  such that  is a subnet of :

\begin{prop}\label{prop:PathsNet}
 Let  be a net of designs of base . Let
  stand for the set of paths  based on
  such that  is a subnet of
 . The following properties are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item If  is a chronicle of  then it is a chronicle of .
\item  is prefix-closed.
\item If  then .
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
As we noticed when defining a path, a prefix of a path is a path, a chronicle is a path, hence the first two items follow. Moreover a view of a path is a chronicle, hence a path.  
\end{proof}


We give in proposition~\ref{prop:characSetOfPaths} an inductive characterization of the set . 
 We prove that chronicles (augmented first with a positive action if the base is positive) are paths, and that paths are obtained inductively by combining paths that are compatible in the sense given in proposition~\ref{createpath}:
  proposition~\ref{createpath} below gives a means for building a path  from two existing ones  and ,
\ie\ to extend  by a suffix of : this extension is a {\em negative jump} at the end of , hence  must not end with a daimon,  must begin with a negative action, and actions in  must also satisfy a few compatibility conditions with respect to .
\begin{prop}\label{createpath}
Let  and  be two paths based on .
The sequence  is
a path based on  if the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item  is a proper action,
\item  is a path based on ,
\item actions in  and   have distinct focuses,
\item  and  are together initial, or are justified by the same positive action, or\footnote{In the case where  contains a positive sequent  and  is anchored in .} , the action  is justified by  and  is initial, 
\item  and  coincide
  except on their last actions or are respectively equal to
   and . 
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}


\begin{proof}
By construction   is alternate, its proper actions have distinct focuses and are  either justified or   initial with a focus in . Moreover, linearity and totality are satisfied and, if present, the daimon ends  hence ends the path. It remains to prove that the constraint (Negative Jump) is satisfied. Let  be an action in  then one has:\\
- If   is a positive proper action occurring in  and  justified by a negative
action  in , then  belongs to : the path  should contain a justification for . Hence in  there is a sequence
  beginning with
, ending with  and such that
 justifies  and
 immediately precedes  in . Then  this sequence is completely included  into . \\
- If   is a positive initial action occurring in  then its focus belongs to some  (in ) and  the only possibility is that   is immediately preceded in
 by a negative action with a focus hereditarily justified by an element
of .
 \end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:characSetOfPaths}
Let  be a net of designs based on .
The set of paths  of  may be exactly
characterized as follows:
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item if  has only negative sequents, then  and the empty path is in ;
\item if there exists a design  of  with a positive base, then  and, for all chronicles  of  beginning with a negative action,  where  is the first action of chronicles of ;
\item if  and  are two paths belonging to  and satisfying the conditions of proposition~\ref{createpath} then
.
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let us give a net  and a set  defined inductively as:
 and
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item If  has only negative sequents, then  and the empty path is in ;
\item If there exists a design  of  with a positive base, 
let  be the first action of its chronicles 
then  and for all chronicle  of  beginning with a negative action,  ;
\item If  and  are two paths belonging to  and satisfying the conditions of proposition~\ref{createpath} then
.
\end{itemize}

\noindent We show below that .
It is straightforward that . Moreover, with notations as in the last item,
. Hence by induction one proves that .

One proves the other inclusion by induction on the length of a path
 of :
\begin{itemize}[label=]
 \item The property is immediate if  is empty, a single action or a chronicle.
 \item If  then  is a
   chronicle, if  then either
    is a chronicle, or  is a chronicle and
    is the first action of a design of  with
   positive base: in all these three cases  belongs to
   .

\item Otherwise  has length at least  and is not a chronicle, hence  has at least two actions less than . 
Note that the longest common suffix of  and  is not empty and begins with a negative action, otherwise it would be  hence  would be a chronicle. 
Let us note this common suffix  and set . The path  is a non-empty path of  hence by induction an element of some . Moreover  ends with a positive proper action.
Either  is reduced to a positive action, hence the base of  is positive and the result follows from the second item in the definition of .
Or  contains at least two actions if  is negative or three actions if  is positive.
Let  be defined in the following way: if the base of  is negative or if this base is positive and  has a first action positive then , otherwise let  be the first action of the design of positive base and set . In the two cases,  and is a path.
Moreover,  is a suffix of . 
Paths  and  satisfy conditions of
proposition~\ref{createpath}:
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item take  as the last action of , hence it is a proper action,
\item take  such that  then  is a path based on ,
\item no actions respectively  in  and   have same focus,
\item if  is initial then let  be the first (initial)  action of  if  is negative or be the second action of  otherwise. If   is justified by a positive action then this last one is followed in  by a negative action : if it were not the case this positive action would be the last of  hence in the common suffix of  and  yielding a contradiction, 
\item  and  coincide
  except on their last actions which are respectively  and
  .
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Hence . 
This ends the induction on the length of paths of .
Thus .
\end{proof}




\section{Normalization paths, visitable paths}\label{section:normalization_visitable}


In~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01}, Girard introduces the concept of {\em dispute}. In a few words, a dispute is a possible travel in a cut-net of designs during normalization. 
Here we will focus on such disputes and more precisely on sequences of actions followed up on one side of an interaction.
In the sequel of this paper, we restrict ourself to particular closed cut-nets. Recall that a closed cut-net is a net of designs where all addresses in bases are part of a cut. 
We distinguish in such a net one design with base  of the form
  (resp. equal to ) and a net of designs which base is noted  and that is equal to , , \dots,  (resp.   equal to , \dots, ). 
The previous section was devoted to define paths in nets of designs.
This section is concerned with {\em normalization paths}, \ie, sequences of actions that may be followed in a normalization. 
We prove that a normalization path is a path. However not all paths are normalization paths as normalization is a kind of `mirror' process: a path  may be followed by normalization iff its {\em dual} noted  is a path, where  has actions of opposite polarities and terminating with a daimon exactly  when  does not end with a daimon. 
Then we determine when  is a path as a condition on .
We finish this section with a more general question: let  be a set of designs of the same base, is it possible to characterize paths on  that may be visited by an element of ?


\begin{defi}[Normalization path]
Let ) be a convergent closed cut-net such that all the cut loci belong to the base of . The {\em normalization path} of the interaction of  with , denoted , is the sequence of actions of  visited during the normalization. It  may be defined by induction on the number  of normalization steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Case :
\begin{itemize}
\item If the interaction stops in one step: either ,
  in this case , or
  the main design (which is not ) is equal to  and
  in this case  is the
  empty sequence.
\item Otherwise let  be the first action of the main
  design. The first action of
   is  if
   is the main design and is 
  otherwise\footnote{Where the notation  is simply
     and may be extended on
    sequences by  and
    .}.
\end{itemize}

\item Case : the prefix  of  is  already defined.\\
Either the interaction stops and  if the main design is a subdesign of , or  if the main design is a subdesign of .\\
Or, let  be the first proper action of the closed cut-net obtained after step ,  begins with  if the main design is a subdesign of , or it begins with  if the main design is a subdesign of .
\end{itemize}
We note  the sequence of actions visited in  during the normalization with .
\end{defi}

The previous definition makes sense because normalization of convergent closed cut-nets is a step by step procedure that satisfies lemma~\ref{lemme:cut-nets}.

\begin{lem}\label{lemme:cut-nets}
Let ) be a convergent closed cut-net such that the base of  contains all the cut-loci.
Every normalization step (until the last one) is a convergent closed
cut-net  ) where:
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item  is a subdesign of ,
\item either  is the main design, or  is
  such that its first action is the dual of the one of the main
  design, that is a subdesign of , or  is a design
  of .
\end{itemize}
\end{lem}

\proof By induction on the number of normalization steps, we prove that a) it occurs in a convergent closed cut-net  ) where  is a subdesign of  and is either the main design or such that its first action is the dual of the one of the main design (except that if the main design is ) and b)  every newly  created  cut-locus appears in the base of a subdesign of  and in the base of a subdesign of .
\begin{enumerate}
\item We consider the first normalization step. The property  b) is satisfied by hypothesis; the property a) is deduced from it:
\begin{itemize}
\item either  is the main design, it is located on a base  while the other designs of the closed cut-net are located on ,
\item or  is located on . Since the base of  contains all the cut loci, the other designs are   based on  , and the designs  based on . The main design is  and since the interaction does not diverge, either  is   or its first positive action  is such that the dual action  is one of the first actions of , then a) is satisfied.
\end{itemize}
\item We prove that the properties a) and b) are preserved during a normalization step:
\begin{itemize}
\item We consider a convergent closed cut-net  where  is a subdesign of  and is the main design based on . If  is not , let  be the focus of its first action. The next normalization step is on the closed cut-net which contains the same designs as before except that  is replaced by several designs  based on  and the design based on  is replaced by its subdesign  based on . The main design is now :
\begin{itemize}
\item Either its first action is   hence a) is satisfied, 
\item or it is a proper action , where  or . In the first case, since the interaction does not diverge, the dual action  is one of the first actions of the subdesign  of , then a) is satisfied. Otherwise . The loci belonging to  are not initial as in such a case they should appear in the base of  in negative position, and this is not possible. So  has been created during the normalization, and then is located in   subdesigns of , that is that there is a subdesign of  based on  and (since the interaction does not diverge) having  as first action. Then a) is satisfied. 
\end{itemize}
Moreover the only new cut loci are the 's which are located on subdesigns of . Hence b) is satisfied.
\item We consider a convergent closed cut-net in which the main design  is not  and is such that the dual of its first action  is one of the first negative action of a subdesign  based on .  The next normalization step is on the closed cut-net which contains the same designs as before except that  is replaced by its subdesign  based on  and some subdesigns  based on . Since  is the main design, a) is satisfied. Moreover the only new cut loci are the 's which are located on  which is a subdesign of . Hence b) is satisfied.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The following proposition shows that normalization paths are paths.
 


\begin{prop}\label{prop:NormPath}
 Let  be a convergent closed cut-net.\\
 is a path on .
 is a path on .
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We prove the first property by induction on the length of a prefix of .\\
- The base case of the induction depends on the polarity of : If  has a negative base then the empty sequence is a path on , otherwise  has a positive base hence there exists a first action in the sequence , this action being the first action of , hence a path on .\\
- Suppose  is a prefix of  and that by induction hypothesis  is a path on .\\
If  is a positive action then, with respect to normalization,  is a chronicle of  that extends , hence  is a path on .\\
If  is an initial negative action hence  is negative and  is the first action of the normalization, \ie, , and  is a path on .\\
Otherwise the focus of the negative action  has been created during normalization by a positive action present in , hence  is a path on .\\
The second property is proved in the same way.
\end{proof}

Note that  is obtained from  by just changing polarities of proper actions and adding a daimon if it were not present in . 
More precisely we define the {\em dual} of a positive alternate sequence of actions  (possibly empty) to be a positive alternate sequence of actions  (possibly empty) in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item If , .
\item Otherwise .
\end{itemize}
 Note that .
It follows from the definition of a normalization path that  iff  such that .
Such a  is unique and is in fact .
Not all paths of  may be visited by a net in  as we show in the next example proposed by Faggian~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Faggian06}.
\begin{exa}
Consider the design  below:
\begin{center}

\end{center}
Its orthogonal  is the following set of nets (where dots may be replaced by any forest of actions such that the result is a design):
\medskip

\noindent Let us consider the path . It is a path of , however it is not visited by a net in : its dual  is   that is not a path.
\end{exa}
In~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Faggian06}, Faggian precisely characterizes {\em strong slices},  \ie\  slices of a design  that may be completely visited with a unique normalization by an orthogonal of . 
Remember that a slice of a design is a {\em multiplicative} subdesign of , \ie\ a focus appears only in a unique negative action.
Furthermore, Faggian showed that a slice is strong iff it is finite and a partial preorder traversal may be defined on it: the root is visited, then in preorder each of its subtrees, the last visited node for each visited subtree being a leaf.
We remark that if  is a normalization path of a design  then  is a strong slice of a : the normalization process defines such a partial order on the design , and by construction  such that it does not contain two negative actions with the same focus, \ie\  is a slice of .
To summarize, let  be a sequence of actions based on , we have that  is a strong slice iff  and  are paths.


Note that the fact that  is a strong slice may be determined by means of constraints  only on . In fact, a dual of a path  is a path if  satisfies the dual of the first item of the Negative Jump constraint we call Restrictive Negative Jump. 
We notice that the Negative Jump together with Restrictive Negative Jump constraints are equivalent to the Visibility constraint in Game Semantics.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:dualpath_restNegJump}
 Let  be a path based on ,  is a path based on  iff  satisfies the following condition:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Restrictive Negative Jump:} for all sequence  that is a subsequence of , if   is a negative action justified by a positive action  then .
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}


\noindent The Restrictive Negative Jump constraint may be explicitly stated as follows:\\
{\em If   is a proper action justified by an
action  then there is a sequence
  beginning with
, ending with  and such that
 immediately precedes  in  and
 justifies .}

\begin{proof}
Suppose  is a path then it satisfies the (Negative
Jump) constraint hence  satisfies its dual, hence in
particular the (Restrictive Negative Jump) constraint.

Suppose  satisfies (Restrictive Negative Jump). Being given the definition of  and the fact that  is a path, the sequence  satisfies conditions (Alternation), (Justification), (Linearity), (Daimon). It remains to check that  satisfies (Totality) and (Negative Jump):
\begin{itemize}
\item (Totality) Note that if  is negative then either  is empty then  is non-empty, or the first action of  is a negative action hence  is non-empty.
\item (Negative Jump)
\begin{itemize}
\item The first item is satisfied by  as  satisfies the Restrictive Negative Jump constraint.
\item Concerning the second item, let  be an initial positive proper action of , then  is negative initial in , hence the first action of  being given the kind of base we consider. The result follows.\qedhere
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\noindent This achieves the characterization of what can be visited in an interaction: let  be a path in a design ,  may be visited in an interaction if, by definition, there exists a design  and . If  is a path then  is a design and we have that . Finally proposition~\ref{prop:dualpath_restNegJump} gives the constraints that  should satisfy for  to be a path.

We now move on to a more general question: let  be a set of designs of the same base, is it possible to characterize paths  on designs of  that may be visited by an orthogonal, \ie, an element of ? A necessary condition is that  is also a path, \ie,  is a strong slice. Note that there is no reason that  may be orthogonal to {\em all} the elements of . Indeed, the fact that  is a path is not a sufficient condition: suppose a design  with a first negative action , then  is a path on ;  is visited by interaction with an element  of  if  contains a design with first positive action ; but as ,  should be one of the first negative actions of each design of . 
This is the keypoint we use in proposition~\ref{stabilite-neg} for 
having a necessary condition for a path to be
 {\em visitable} in a set of designs . Note that this 
condition
 does not make direct reference to elements of .

\begin{defi}[Visitability in a Set of Designs]
Let  be a set of designs of the same base,
a path  is {\em visitable in } if there exists a design  and a net  such that . 
\end{defi}

\rem A visitable path  is positive (\ie, its last action is a positive one). Obviously, with notations as in the definition, ; moreover  such that  then  as normalization is deterministic.

\begin{prop}\label{stabilite-neg}
Let  be a set of designs and let  be a positive path of a design of ,
\begin{center}
If the path  is {\em visitable in } 
then  

\end{center}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that  is a path visitable in , then there exists a design  and a net  such that , hence  is a path (in ). Let  be a prefix of  and  be a design of  such that . 
Note that  cannot end with a daimon.
Since  is a path of , and that normalization is deterministic and , then  is a prefix of .
Suppose first that  is a negative action:
\begin{itemize}
\item If  is empty, the base of designs of  is negative, \ie, of the form  and nets  in  have bases , , ..., . So normalizations between  and designs in  must begin with the same first positive action  of , hence  should be a first action in all designs in , thus a path in all designs in .
\item Otherwise, we note that after  steps of normalization between  and , the cut-net consists of a net  of subdesigns of  and a net  of subdesigns of designs of . Moreover, there is exactly one design of positive base in this cut-net and this design belongs to  as  ends with a positive action.
Furthermore,  is also the net obtained from  after  steps in the normalization between  and . Then  is the next action to be used by normalization with 
, hence also with  (for normalization to proceed). Thus  is a path of  .\qedhere
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}[Completion of designs]\label{defi:closure}
Let  be a design of base , the {\tt completion} of , noted , is the design of base  obtained from  in the following way:\\
\centerline{
	 is a chronicle of base 
}\\
Let  be a net of designs, the {\em completion} of  also written  is the net of completions of designs of .
\end{defi}

\noindent Note that  is a design:
First, an action  is either initial or justified by the last action of  (in ) hence linearity is satisfied.
Second, as chronicles  are in  and  are negative actions, chronicles  are pairwise coherent and coherent with actions of .

\begin{prop}\label{prop:completed_subdesign}
Let  be a design in a behaviour , let  then .
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let . Hence . Let  be the longest positive-ended path in the design  that is a prefix of . 
Either , hence , and also . 
Or there exist actions ,  and a sequence  such that . 
Consider the chronicle  such that . By construction, . Either  hence also  as  and there is a unique positive action after a negative action. Contradiction as  is then not maximal. 
Or  hence .
\end{proof}

The proposition~\ref{prop:completed_subdesign} is also true when we have nets of designs instead of designs.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:visitable-carac}
Let  be a set of designs of same base.
Let  be a path of a design of .
 is visitable in  iff .
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that  is visitable in . Then there exist  and  such that . 
Furthermore  is a path in , hence . It follows from proposition~\ref{prop:completed_subdesign} that . \\
Suppose that , let  be the design in  such that  is a path of . Note that  and that .
\end{proof}

Proposition~\ref{prop:visitable-carac} gives a means to compute the set of visitable paths of a set  of designs of the same base (when  is a finite set of finite designs): take each positive-ended path  of some design of , test if for all design  in  we have . This method may be improved by considering only paths that satisfy the necessary constraint given in proposition~\ref{stabilite-neg}.

\begin{cor}
The set of paths visitable in , noted , is positive-prefix closed:
if  then .

\section{Incarnation expressed by means of paths}\label{sec:Incarnation}




\subsection{Incarnation}

A behaviour may contain useless designs with respect to orthogonality. This is clear when considering a design as a set of paths:  if  is a behaviour and  then designs in  obtained from  by extending one of its paths are useless with respect to membership to . This suggests the following definition:

\begin{defi}[Incarnation]\label{incarnationdessein}
Let  be a behaviour,  be a design in . 
\begin{itemize}
\item  is the {\em incarnation} of  with respect to the behaviour . 
\item  is {\em material} in  if .
\item The {\em incarnation}  of a behaviour  is the  set of its material designs.
\end{itemize}
 is simply noted  when  is clear from the context.
\end{defi}

Note that  is a design: if  then 
 is a path included in , thus  is a design included in . 
Furthermore, by construction, . Hence .


 With respect to the inclusion relation on designs belonging to a given behaviour, the minimal designs are in the incarnation of this behaviour.
This is the core of the definition given by Girard in~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01}:
\begin{prop}
Let  be a behaviour,  be a design in .
If  is minimal in  with respect to inclusion then .
\end{prop}

Note that the previous property is also true in the more general setting defined by Basaldella and Faggian for dealing with exponentials in Ludics~\cite{DBLP:conf/lics/BasaldellaF09}. The converse property, \ie, the fact that actions can only be used once in a normalization, is not true in their setting. In the present paper, thanks to linearity, the converse property does hold,. Linearity induces the following fact:  (see also~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01}).

\begin{prop}
Let  be a behaviour,  be a design in .
If 
then  is minimal in  with respect to inclusion.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Remark that .
To obtain a design  strictly included in , we have to erase at least a chronicle  (and its extensions). But there is at least a path  such that    hence if we denote by  a net such that  we have by linearity constraint on designs that . Hence .
\end{proof}

Incarnation may be also defined for a set  of nets of designs, when such a set  is the orthogonal of a set  of designs of the same base, \ie, :
\begin{defi}
Let  be a set of designs of the same base  (resp. ),  be a net of designs belonging to , with  of base  for  and  based on . 
With , let  be a net of designs such that  is a design with the same base as .\\
The {\em incarnation} of , denoted , is the net .\\
The {\em incarnation} of , written , is the set of nets of designs .
\end{defi}

The incarnation of such nets of designs is well-defined: with notations given in the previous definition, for all , , hence  is a design included in .
Furthermore, for all , . Hence .
Abusively, we note .

\vspace{.5cm}
Let us consider a set of designs  of the same base, we
gave a necessary condition in proposition~\ref{stabilite-neg} for a path to be visitable in ,
 notice now that visitability is sufficient for computing the incarnation of a design in the behaviour generated by : it follows from the definition that  when . 
In other words, it is not necessary to compute the behaviour of a set of designs for computing the incarnation of its designs.
This suggests the following questions. Is it possible to compute directly the incarnation of the behaviour generated by , resting only on the paths visitable in ? 
Are designs in  all necessary for computing this incarnation?
We remark below that none of these questions admits an obvious answer: on the one hand the biorthogonal may contain designs that are built from parts of several designs of , on the other hand even if some kinds of designs are clearly redundant some other cases remain out of reach. 

One of the easiest kind of designs of a biorthogonal that may be clearly generated from already known designs concerns those obtained by replacing subtrees by daimons.
In fact this is part of an explicit characterization of the relation , that reads  is more defined than , between designs with the same base. The relation  holds whenever .
This characterization is part of the {\em separation theorem}~\cite{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01}:
the relation  is a partial order and we have that  iff every chronicle  can be written  for a certain  such that .
The relation  subsumes the inclusion relation. Indeed, we have of course that if  then . 
This is already taken into account in incarnation as a material design is minimal with respect to inclusion in a behaviour.
There is another fact causing a design  to be more defined than a design : by substituting chronicles  in  by the only chronicle  in . As a consequence, if  is in the behaviour  then so is , moreover if  is in the incarnation  then so is .
We call such a set of designs  the {\em daimon closure} of  and we note it  (see next definition). 
Relations of inclusion and to be more defined, as well as the daimon closure of a design, are schematized in Figure~\ref{fig:daimon_closure}.

\begin{defi}[Daimon closure]
Let  be a design, the {\em daimon closure} of , denoted by ,
is the set of designs obtained from  by substituting, for some set of  negative chronicles , all the chronicles  by the chronicles .\\
Let  be a set of designs of the same base, the daimon closure of  noted  is the set .\\
\end{defi}


To rephrase what precedes, behaviours and incarnation are `closed under daimon'. Hence the complement  of  in  is sufficient for generating the incarnation of . However this does not fully address the question: in example~\ref{examples_4}, designs  and  are sufficient for generating the incarnation of, say, .
\begin{exa}\label{examples_3}
We have that  where:\footnote{In the representation of designs, we may choose to put  or  in any of the branches when they are not a focus of an action. The choice we take has no consequence on the result.}\\



\end{exa}



\begin{exa}\label{examples_4}
We have that  where:

\end{exa}



Note that each design is obtained from each other one by commuting some actions.
Obviously, such commutations do not always give rise to elements of the biorthogonal as it depends on the rest of the set of designs. Moreover, designs in the incarnation may not necessarily be obtained this way: In example~\ref{examples_3}, designs  and  are built by adding the pair of actions  into paths which become visitable reversing proposition~\ref{stabilite-neg}: every path in a dual design travels through this pair.

\vspace{1em}


\vspace{.5cm}
From the previous remarks, it seems that there is no clear way to compute directly an incarnation. To circumvent this difficulty, we use in this paper an indirect approach for computing an incarnation. 
First, as we develop it in the next subsection, the incarnation  may be defined by means of  only, where  is a set of designs.
Second we remark with the following proposition that . Hence computing an incarnation involves twice the same procedure, \ie, computing the incarnation of the dual.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:charac_incarnation_dualdual}
Let  be a set of designs of the same base ,
.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We already noticed that . Hence .
Let , for all ,  hence  is a normalization path in , hence also in . Thus . 
\end{proof}


\subsection{Direct computation of the incarnation of the dual of a set of designs}
 
Let us define
. It is obvious that if  is visitable in  then  is visitable in . In other words, . 
Recall that a design in  should be the set of views of coherent paths of . Moreover, such a design should be orthogonal to each design in , hence
maximal cliques of  are natural candidates for defining designs of . 
This is not sufficient. Indeed we get a counter-example by transposing in Ludics an example used by Ehrhard for the study of hypercoherences~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Ehrhard00}. In that counter-example~\ref{exa:anticlique}, we notice that the infinite sequence resulting   of an increasing sequence of visitable paths has to belong to some design of .
With that constraint we are able to characterize the incarnation of the dual (propositions~\ref{prop:clique_dual} and~\ref{prop:cs_clique_dual}).
First of all, we remark with the following proposition that the dual of a clique of visitable paths is an anticlique of paths, this property is necessary for proving materiality.

\begin{prop}
Let  be a set of designs based on ,  and  be two distinct paths of ,
\begin{itemize}
\item if  then ,
\item if  is a clique of paths based on  visitable in  then  is an anticlique of paths based on .
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let  be two distinct paths of , and suppose that :
\begin{itemize}
\item Either one sequence strictly extends the other: w.l.o.g. . 
Then  and . The paths  and  are strictly incoherent.
\item Or there exists two distinct negative actions  and  such that  and . 
Then  and   which are strictly incoherent. 
\end{itemize}
It follows that if  is a clique of  then  is an anticlique of paths.
\end{proof}

Let  be a set of visitable paths. The fact that  is an anticlique of paths (a set of pairwise incoherent paths) does not ensure that  is a clique, as the following example shows.
\begin{exa}\label{exa:anticlique}
Let  where:\\
\begin{center}

~~~and~~~

\end{center}
Paths  
and  defined below are incoherent positive visitable paths in  and  and  are also incoherent:\\
\\
.
\end{exa}

We give below a direct characterization of the incarnation of the dual of a set of designs .
Though simple, it has the disadvantage of requiring a test toward each design of the set . We develop in propositions~\ref{prop:clique_dual} and~\ref{prop:cs_clique_dual} a more complex characterization that considers only tests toward the set of visitable paths of .

\begin{prop}
Let  be a set of designs based on . Let  such that for all design ,  and  is a clique of , then  belongs to .
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
--  is a clique then  is a design.\\
-- As normalisation is deterministic and by construction of , we have that for all design , , \ie, .\\
-- Suppose there exists a strict subnet  of  that is in . Hence there exists a path  and . By construction of , there exists a design  such that . Hence normalisation between  and  fails : . Contradiction. Then .
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let  be a set of designs based on . 
Let  then there exists  such that for all design , ,  is a clique of  and .
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
As , we know that . Let us consider  where .
\begin{itemize}
\item By construction,  is a subset of  and for all design , . 
\item As  is a design and ,  is a clique.\qedhere
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

Let us consider now what constraints should be required on such sets  referring only to visitable paths for  to give rise to a design of the incarnation of the dual.

To be a maximal clique of  is not sufficient for characterizing the material designs of , when  is a set of designs. 
Two additional constraints are required.
First, such a set of paths  should be {\em saturated} with respect to paths of : if a visitable path can be followed in a design  of  and dually in  then the next positive action in  should be present dually in the path of , except when this positive action is a daimon.
Second, the intersection of the anticlique made of duals with designs of  should be, in some way, {\em finite}.
Indeed, the same phenomenon also happens with serial-parallel coherence spaces (the ones obtained from  with the connectives  and ): being given a family of maximal cliques that covers a coherent space, maximal anticliques cut each such maximal clique if the space is finite, this is not always the case if the space is infinite. Example~\ref{example-infini} given below is a transposition in Ludics of the one given by T. Ehrhard in his study of hypercoherences~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/Ehrhard00}.

\begin{exa}\label{example-infini}





Let us consider designs generated by the following grammar ():\\
\begin{center}

\vspace{0,5em}

\noindent For all , we note  the maximal chronicle of the design . We note  the dual of . 
Remark that, for all , 

Hence for all , 

Furthermore for all ,  is a design as well as  and .\\
\vspace{1em}For example,

and

Consider the two following designs:

and the two following sets of designs:

Observe that  is the set of positive prefixes of paths  for all .
We have that  and . 
The remainders of  and  are obtained from designs of  by replacing proper positive chronicles  and their extensions by chronicles . 
The sets of views of maximal cliques of  are then exactly material designs of .
We note that .
Indeed,  is not orthogonal to  since their interaction does not end.
In other words, this is so because  is an infinite sequence of actions in  whose dual is included in .
Excepting this case, the other sets of views of maximal cliques of  are exactly material designs of .
\end{exa}

  
\begin{defi}
Let  be a set of designs based on . Let  be a
set of paths of designs of .
\begin{itemize}[label=]
\item The set  is {\bf finite-stable} when 
for all strictly increasing sequence  of elements of ,

          with , we have that  is a prefix of an
         element of .

\end{defi}
 

 
\begin{prop}\label{prop:clique_dual}
Let  be a set of designs based on . Let  such that  is finite-stable, saturated and  is a maximal clique of . Then , the set of views of paths in , is a design that belongs to .
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that , then  and  and the result follows.
In the following we consider that there are some non empty paths visitable in .
As  is a clique of ,  is a net of designs.
\begin{itemize}
\item The net  is in :\\
Let . We prove that there is a path . This way we prove that  : either  or  ends with a daimon hence the interaction finishes well. We note  the set of paths in  that end with a positive action and  are prefixes of paths in  (hence visitable in ).
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose that  is not empty. Because  is finite-stable and , sequences of elements of  cannot be infinite strictly increasing. Hence we may consider a path  maximal in , \ie, maximal such that  ends with a positive action and is a prefix of an element of . Note that if  ends with a daimon then .
Either , hence , thus . 
Or there are a negative action  and a sequence  such that . Hence, from proposition~\ref{stabilite-neg}, .
Moreover  has an extension  in . 
We construct now a net in  that `forces' the interaction with :

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
let  &  &  is a prefix of  and  is not a prefix of  \\
	&&  is a path of a design in 
\end{tabular}

 and consider the net .
We have that  is in : , hence a normalisation path between a design of  and  either follows  or diverges from it on a negative action, in the two cases interaction finishes well as  is ``completed'' by means of all possible negative actions, each of them followed by a daimon. 
Then , hence .\\
If  then  and , thus . 
Otherwise, as  is saturated,  is a prefix of an element of   then we have a contradiction with the fact that  is maximal in .

\item We prove now that  is not empty.\\
Suppose that the base of  is positive. Let  be the first action of , the path  is visitable in .
If there is no path in  beginning with this action , the path  is coherent with all the paths of  against the maximality of . 
Hence either  or  there is a  path  in  extending  and . \\
 Suppose now that the base of  is negative.
 Either  and the result follows, or all paths in  begin with the same proper positive action . 
Hence there are sequences  such that  and then, for all , , in particular . 
If , then . 
Otherwise there is a unique action  such that . Furthermore, : since  there is at least a net in  containing  as unique first action and then, since this net is orthogonal to  it has to contain a path extending . 
If there is no path in   extending   with the action , the path  is coherent with all the paths of  against the maximality of . Or there is a (proper) path  in  extending  and . 
\end{itemize}

 
\item The net  is material in .\\
Suppose there exists a strict subnet  of  that is in . Hence there exists a path  and . As , there exists a design  and . Note that there exists a unique path in  as  is an anticlique and  is a design. As , .
Hence . Moreover, , thus , hence coherent with paths in , hence  as  is a maximal clique. But  and the two paths belong to . Contradiction.\qedhere
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

The next proposition shows that one exactly recovers , the incarnation of , from the set of maximal cliques of  which are dual to finite-stable subsets of .

\begin{prop}\label{prop:cs_clique_dual}
Let  be a set of designs of the same base. 
Let  then there exists  such that  is finite-stable and saturated and  is a maximal clique of  and .
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
As , we know that . Let us consider  where .
\begin{itemize}
\item By construction  is a subset of . 
\item As  is a design and ,  is a clique.
\item Suppose  is not a maximal clique of : there exists a path  such that  and . The path  thus there exists  and  and . Moreover there exists  and . As , then . But these two paths  and  belong to the same design . Contradiction. Then  is a maximal clique of .
\item Suppose that there exists a strictly increasing sequence  of prefixes of paths of  and  such that . 
Note that  is a sequence of prefixes of paths of . If the sequence is infinite strictly increasing, the normalization between  and  does not finish, contradicting the fact that normalization ends between  and .
\item  is saturated: Suppose that  is a prefix of an element of  and  with . There exists a design  such that . Furthermore . As normalisation is deterministic and , there exists a sequence  such that . Hence  is a prefix of an element of .\qedhere
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:incarnation_by_dual}
Let  be a set of designs based on . The incarnation of the behaviour generated by  is determined by applying the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the set of paths of  which may be the visitable paths of  (by means of proposition \ref{stabilite-neg}).
\item Establish , the set of visitable paths of , by keeping from the previous set the paths passing the proposition~\ref{prop:visitable-carac} .
\item Obtain  from the set of maximal cliques  of  such that  is finite-stable and saturated.
\item Establish   (again by means of propositions \ref{stabilite-neg} and~~\ref{prop:visitable-carac}), the set of visitable paths of .
\item Obtain  from the set of maximal cliques  of  such that  is finite-stable and saturated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Propositions~\ref{stabilite-neg},~\ref{prop:visitable-carac},~\ref{prop:clique_dual} and \ref{prop:cs_clique_dual} allow for computing the incarnation of the {\em dual} of a set of designs. Hence the incarnation of the behaviour generated by  is established by using twice this process (proposition~\ref{prop:charac_incarnation_dualdual}).
\end{proof}


\rem Our construction freely captures the part of incarnation corresponding to a ``daimon closure'': 
 is already closed under daimon as   is positive-prefix closed.






\section{Conclusion}

 
Incarnation is an original concept introduced in Ludics by Girard. Indeed the denotation of a formula is a behaviour, a set of designs. The incarnation of a behaviour is the subset of designs that are fully used by interaction. In this paper, we addressed a more general question: is it possible to compute the incarnation of the behaviour generated by a set  of designs of the same base, without necessarily computing explicitly this behaviour?
What we could rephrase by saying that we want to isolate, among the information contained in the designs of , elementary components that it would have been enough to reorganize to calculate this incarnation. 
Our characterization of what is a ``visitable path in a set of designs'' is a key ingredient for that purpose (propositions~\ref{stabilite-neg} and ~\ref{prop:visitable-carac}). 
From this result, we were able to characterize designs in the incarnation of the orthogonal  as maximal cliques of visitable paths such that their dual are finite-stable and saturated (propositions~\ref{prop:clique_dual} and~\ref{prop:cs_clique_dual}).
We deduced then the incarnation as a twofold process (proposition~\ref{prop:incarnation_by_dual}).

In fact, the notion of incarnation suggests implicitly and indirectly the hope of finding a kind of ``basis'' (as defined in vector spaces): the incarnation of a behaviour contains enough information to find all its elements, it also avoids some redundancy since it contains only the minimal designs with respect to inclusion. Can we go further? A first step is easy to cross: we could consider a concept a little ``finer'' than that of incarnation by taking only designs minimal with respect to the relation  recalled in section~\ref{sec:Incarnation} and that serves for the separation theorem. In fact the set  if  then  is a subset of . 
And it suffices to take its closure by daimon to find the usual incarnation.
