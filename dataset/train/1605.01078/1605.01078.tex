In order to compare the performance of the traditional BLAS \dgemm\ routine and the various implementations of
\strassen, we define the \emph{effective} \GFLOPS{} metric for
 matrix multiplication, similar to \cite{StrassenBenson,PPL2,StrassenLipshitz}:

We next derive a model to predict the execution time  and the \emph{effective} \GFLOPS\ of the traditional
BLAS \dgemm\ and the various implementations of \strassen.  
Theoretical predictions allow us to compare and contrast different implementation decisions, help with 
performance debugging, and (if sufficiently accurate) can be used to 
choose the right member of the family of implementations as a function of the number of threads used and/or problem size.
\NoShow{In future research, we envision also using the estimated cost for task scheduling on the heterogeneous or multi-core parallel
architecture.  More on this in the conclusion.

\subsubsection*{Assumption}
Our performance model assumes that the underlying architecture has a modern \fromto{cache}{memory} hierarchy \fromto{with 
a small piece of fast memory (L1/L2/LLC cache) and a large chunk of slow memory (DRAM).}{with fast caches and relatively slow main memory (DRAM).}
We\fromto{ also}{} assume the latency for accessing the fast memory can be ignored \fromto{}{(either because it can be overlapped with computation or because it can be amortized over sufficient computation)} while the latency of loading from main memory is exposed.
For memory store operations, our model assumes that a lazy write-back policy guarantees the time for storing
into fast memory can be hidden.
The slow memory operations for BLAS \dgemm\ and the various implementation of \strassen{} consist of three
parts: (1) memory packing in (adapted) \dgemm\ routine; (2) reading/writing the submatrices of  in (adapted) \dgemm\ routine; and (3) reading/writing of
the temporary buffer that are part of  \XXXstrassen\ and \ABXstrassen, outside (adapted) \dgemm{} routine.
Based on these assumptions, the execution time is dominated by the arithmetic operations and the slow memory operations.

\subsubsection*{Notation}
\fromto{We define , , ,  and  here.}{}
Parameter   denotes the time (in seconds) of one \underline{a}rithmetic (floating point) operation, i.e., the reciprocal of the theoretical peak \GFLOPS\ of the system.
Parameter  (\underline{b}andwidth, memory operation) denotes the amortized time (in seconds) of a unit (one double precision floating point number,
or eight bytes) of contiguous data movement from DRAM to cache.
\fromto{}{{In practice, 
For single core, we need to further multiply it by the number of channels.}}

The total execution time (in seconds), , is broken down into 
the time for \underline{a}rithmetic operations, , and
\underline{m}emory operations:

\NoShow{
With this, \eref{e:egflops1} can be rewritten as

}





\subsubsection*{Arithmetic Operations}
We break down  into separate terms: 

where  is the arithmetic time for submatrix multiplication, and , ,  
denote the arithmetic time of extra additions with submatrices of , , , respectively. For \dgemm\, since there are no
extra additions, . For one-level \strassen{},  is comprised of 7 submatrix multiplications, 5 extra additions
of submatrices of  and , and 12 extra additions of submatrices of . Therefore, 
\fromto{}{}.
\fromto{\color{red} I prefer the  etc. at the end of the formula.}{}
Note that the matrix addition actually involves 2 floating point operations for each entry because they are cast as\fromto{``{\tt axpy}'' or bottom level}{}
{\tt FMA} instructions.
Similar analyses can be applied to compute  of a two-level \strassen\ implementation.
A full analysis is summarized in \figref{tab:breakdown}.

\subsubsection*{Memory Operations}
The total data movement overhead is determined by both the original matrix sizes , , , and block sizes
, ,  in our implementation \figref{fig:side_by_side}(right).
We characterize each memory operation term in \figref{tab:breakdown} by its read/write type and the amount of memory (one unitdouble precision floating number sizeeight bytes) involved in the movement.
We decompose  into

where ,  are the data movement time for reading from submatrices of , , respectively, for packing
 inside \GOTO{} \gemm\ algorithm (\figref{fig:side_by_side});
 is the data movement time for loading \emph{and} storing submatrices of  inside \gemm\ algorithm;
, ,  are the data movement time for loading \emph{or} storing submatrices of , , , respectively, related to the temporary buffer as part of \XXXstrassen\ and \ABXstrassen{}; the s denote the corresponding coefficients, which are also tabulated in \figref{tab:breakdown}.



All write operations (,  for storing submatrices of , , respectively, into packing buffers) are omitted because our assumption of lazy write-back policy with fast memory. Notice that memory operations can recur multiple times depending on the loop in which they reside.
For instance, for two-level \strassen{},
\fromto{}
{}
denotes the cost of reading and writing the  submatrices of  as intermediate result inside the micro-kernel. This is a step function proportional to , because submatrices of  are used to accumulate the \rankk{} update in the 5th loop in \figref{fig:side_by_side}(right).




\subsection{Discussion}
From the analysis summarized in~\figref{tab:breakdown} we can 
make predications about the relative performance of the various implementations.  It helps to also view the predictions as graphs, 
which we give in~\figref{fig:model}, using parameters that capture the architecture described in Section~\ref{sec:perf:single_node}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	Asymptotically, the two-level \strassen\ implementations outperform corresponding one-level \strassen\ implementations, which in turn outperform the traditional \dgemm\ implementation.
	\NoShow{\item
	Asymptotically, when , , and  are all large, \XXXstrassen\ may actually outperform the other implementations. 
	This is because the use of temporary buffers 
	However, this is for matrices large enough that we do not see this in~\figref{fig:model}.
    }
	\item
	The graph for \mbox{, 1 core}, shows that for smaller square matrices, \ABCstrassen\ outperforms \ABXstrassen, but for larger square matrices this trend reverses.  This holds for both one-level and two-level \strassen{}.   The reason is that for small  \ABCstrassen\ reduced the number of times the temporary matrix  needs to be brought in from memory to be added to submatrices of .  For large , it increases the number of times the elements of those submatrices of  themselves are moved in and out of memory.
	\item
	The graph for \mbox{,  varies, 1 core,} is particularly interesting: it shows that for  equal to the appropriate multiple of  ( for one-level and  for two-level) \ABCstrassen\ performs dramatically better than the other implementations, as expected.
\end{itemize}
\NoShow{7. (Wrong) Conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0--2: \dgemm\
\item 2--: \ABCstrassen{} or \ABXstrassen{}
\item : \XXXstrassen{}
\end{itemize}
}The bottom line: depending on the problem size, a different implementation 
may have its advantages.



\NoShow{The performance model help us understand of why the different implementations perform as observed. It establishes that we understand what is going on as the data is being moved within the fast and slow memory.
