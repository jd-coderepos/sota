\section{Introduction}
Finite state machines (FSMs) are widely used in modeling complex systems ranging from computer and communication networks, automated manufacturing systems, air traffic management systems, distributed software systems, among many others, see e.g. \cite{cassandras,ModelChecking}. 
The increasing complexity of large scale systems demanded during the years for formal methods that can render their analysis tractable from a computational complexity point of view. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, which include abstraction, modular verification methods, symmetry and partial order reduction, see e.g. \cite{ModelChecking}. The common goal of these approaches is to find an FSM that is equivalent to the original one, but with a set of states of smaller size. 
In this paper we follow the approach by Alur and co--workers (see e.g. \cite{HFSM1,CHSM}), where a complex system is viewed as a "non--flat" system. 
A non--flat system is a "finite state machine" where each "state" can be either a basic state or a superstate \cite{statecharts} that hides inside an FSM or even a composition of FSMs. By expanding the superstates of a non--flat system to their corresponding FSMs an ordinary FSM is obtained. One of the early non--flat systems that appeared in the literature are \textit{hierarchical state machines} (HSMs) \cite{HFSM1}. 
While HSMs well capture modeling features of many design languages as for example Statecharts \cite{statecharts}, they only consider sequential interaction among the FSMs involved. \textit{Recursive state machines} (RSMs) \cite{RFSM} extend HSMs by allowing recursion in the sequential interaction of FSMs. As such, they well model sequential programming languages with recursive procedure calls. 
\textit{Recursive Game Graphs}, a natural adaptation of RSMs to a game theoretic setting, have been studied in \cite{Etessami2004}; \textit{Pushdown Graphs} have been studied in \cite{Cachat2002a}. 
Both HSMs and RSMs do not exhibit concurrent compositional features. \textit{Communicating hierarchical state machines} (CHSMs) \cite{CHSM} generalize HSMs, by allowing FSMs to interact not only sequentially but also concurrently, through the notion of parallel composition. Reachability problems and checking language and bisimulation equivalences for CHSMs are proven in \cite{CHSM} to fall in the class of exponential time and space complexity problems. This complexity result is in line with the ones further established in \cite{StateExplosion2,StateExplosion1} on  complexity arising in checking a range of equivalence notions in the linear time--branching time spectrum \cite{Spectrum} for networks of FSMs, modeled by parallel composition of FSMs. 
By following the conjecture of Rabinovich in \cite{StateExplosion0}, the work in \cite{StateExplosion2,StateExplosion1} strongly suggest that there is no way to escape the so--called state explosion problem, when checking behavioral relations and in particular bisimulation equivalence, for non--flat systems exhibiting concurrent--types interaction. \\
In this paper we identify a novel class of concurrent non--flat systems, termed \textit{Arenas of Finite State Machines} (AFSMs) for which complexity reduction via bisimulation can be performed without incurring in the state explosion problem. AFSMs are collections of FSMs that interact concurrently, through a communication network. For AFSMs we propose a notion of equivalence, termed \textit{compositional bisimulation}, that is based on the communication network governing the interaction mechanism among the FSMs. The main contribution of the paper resides in showing that compositional bisimulation equivalence between AFSMs implies bisimulation equivalence between the corresponding expanded FSMs. 
This result is important because it implies that all properties preserved by bisimulation equivalence, e.g. linear temporal logic properties \cite{ModelChecking}, are also preserved by compositional bisimulation. Therefore, it can be of help in the formal verification and control design of complex systems modeled by AFSMs that admit compositional bisimulation. 
A computational complexity analysis reported in the paper reveals that 
checking compositional bisimulation between a pair of AFSMs scales as  in space complexity and as  in time complexity, with the numbers  and  of FSMs composing the AFSMs.  
A standard approach, based on expanding the AFSMs to the corresponding FSMs exhibits an exponential space and time complexity. 
An application of the proposed results to the modeling and complexity reduction of the regulation of gene expression in the single--celled bacterium \textit{E. coli} is included.

\section{Preliminary definitions}
\label{Sec:FSM}
\subsection{Notation}
Given a set , the symbol  denotes the set of subsets of  and the symbol  denotes the cardinality of . 
If  then  is said a singleton. 
A relation  is said to be total if for any  there exists  such that  and conversely, for any  there exists  such that . Given a relation , the inverse of , denoted , is defined as . A relation  is the identity relation if  and  for all . A directed graph is a tuple  where  is the set of vertices and  is the set of edges. We denote by  the set of positive integers. 

\subsection{Finite State Machines}
In this paper we consider finite state machines in the formulation of Moore \cite{Moore} where states are labeled with outputs and transitions are labeled with inputs.
\begin{definition} 
\cite{FSMmin} 
\label{DefFSM}
A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a tuple 

where  is a finite set of states,  is the initial state,  is a finite set of input symbols,  is a finite set of output symbols,   is an output map, and  is a transition relation. 
\end{definition}
When  is skipped from the tuple in (\ref{FSMtuple}) any state in  is assumed to be an initial state. 
We denote a transition  of FSM  by .  
By definition of , a transition of the form  is allowed. Such a transition is viewed as private or internal to . Throughout the paper we refer to an input  as internal, and an input  as external to . 
Analogously, for a state ,  is allowed, meaning that state  is not visible from the external environment. 
Despite classical formulations of Moore machines that model the transition relation as  and the output function as , we model here  as a subset of  and  as a function from  to . By this choice, multiple interactions of FSMs can be considered, as illustrated in Example \ref{exex} on a simple distributed system. 

\subsection{Equivalence notions}
Several notions of equivalence have been proposed for the class of finite state machines, see e.g. \cite{Spectrum}. 
In this paper we focus on the notion of bisimulation equivalence \cite{Milner,Park} that 
is widely used as an effective tool to mitigate complexity of verification and control design of large scale complex systems, see e.g. \cite{ModelChecking}. 
Consider a pair of FSMs  (). 
We start by recalling the notion of isomorphism. 
\begin{definition}
\label{DefIso}
The FSMs  and  are isomorphic, denoted , if there exists a bijective function  such that 
,  for any , and  if and only if . 
\end{definition}
The notion of isomorphism is an equivalence relation on the class of FSMs. 
The notion of bisimulation equivalence is reported hereafter.
\begin{definition}
\label{Bis} 
A set  is a bisimulation relation between  to  if for any ,
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] ;
\item[(ii)] existence of  implies existence of  such that  and ;
\item[(iii)] existence of  implies existence of  such that  and .
\end{itemize}
FSMs  and  are bisimilar, denoted , if 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(iv)] \mbox{}.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

When the initial states  and  are skipped from the tuples  and , condition (iv) is replaced by requiring relation  to be total. 
Bisimulation equivalence is an equivalence relation on the class of FSMs. 
The maximal bisimulation relation between FSMs  and  is a bisimulation relation  such that  for any bisimulation relation  between  and . The maximal bisimulation relation exists and is unique. Given an  FSM  the set  is an equivalence relation on the set of states of . 
The quotient of  induced by , denoted , is the FSM bisimilar to  with the minimal number of states \cite{ModelChecking}. FSM  exists and is unique up to isomorphisms.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma}
If  then .
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let  be the set of states of . 
Minimality of  and  implies that the maximal bisimulation relation  between  and  is such that for any  and , sets  and  are singletons. Hence, define function  by  when . It is easy to see that function  satisfies the properties required in Definition \ref{DefIso}.
\end{proof}

We conclude this section by recalling space and time complexity in checking bisimulation equivalence between FSMs. 
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop21}
\cite{BisAlg}
Space complexity in checking  is .
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop22}
\cite{BisAlg}
Time complexity in checking  is . 
\end{proposition}

\section{Arenas of finite state machines}
In this section we introduce a new class of non--flat systems \cite{HFSM1,CHSM}, called \textit{Arenas of Finite State Machines} (AFSMs). AFMSs 
are collections of FSMs that interact concurrently through a communication network. 
The syntax of an AFSM is specified by a directed graph: 

where  is a collection of  FSMs  and  describes the communication network of the FSMs . 
In the definition of  self loops  would model communication of  with itself, which is tautological. For this reason in the sequel we assume . 
By expanding each vertex  of  an ordinary FSM is obtained, which is defined by:

where , , , , , and  is such that 

whenever  is a transition of  for some  () and 

where . 

\begin{proposition}
Given an AFSM , the FSM  is unique.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Entities , , ,  and  in  are uniquely determined from . For any collection of  transitions  in  there exists one and only one transition in  of the form (\ref{ttrans}) with  uniquely specified by (\ref{u}).
\end{proof}

FSM  specifies the semantics of the AFSM . Such a semantic is implicitly given through a composition of FSMs that can be regarded as a notion of parallel composition \cite{ModelChecking} that respects the topology of the AFMS communication network. 
The following simple example illustrates syntax and semantics of AFSMs.
\begin{example}
\label{exex}
Consider a distributed system composed of three computers ,  and , whose goal is to compute the Euclidean norm  of a vector  in a distributed fashion. 
While  and  are delegated to compute respectively  and ,  takes as inputs the computations of  and  and outputs . 
This simple distributed system can be modeled as the AFMS  where  and 
. 
FSMs , each one modeling computers , are illustrated in Figures\footnote{Each circle denotes a state and each edge a transition. In each circle, upper symbol denotes the state and lower symbol the output set associated with the state; symbols labeling edges denote the input sets associated with the transitions.} \ref{FSMs1}(a)(b)(c), while AFSM , modeling the computers' network, is depicted in Figure \ref{FSMs1}(d). 
By expanding , the FSM  is obtained, whose accessible part\footnote{The accessible part of the FSM  in (\ref{FSMtuple}) is the unique sub--finite state machine extracted from , containing all and only the states of  that are reachable (or equivalently, accessible) in a finite number of transitions from its initial state , see e.g. \cite{cassandras}.} 
is depicted in Figure \ref{M(A)}. Starting from , when receiving the input , FSM  outputs in state  the set  and finally in state  the requested output . For illustrating the construction of FSM , we describe in detail the construction of the transition . By applying the compositional rules defining the semantics of AFSMs, one gets: 
 is in ,  is in , and  is in . Moreover, one first note that  and , from which . 
The resulting transition  is indeed in , as shown in Figure \ref{M(A)}.

\section{Compositional bisimulation of AFSMs}
A na\"ive approach to check bisimulation equivalence of two AFSMs  and  consists in first expanding them to FSMs  and  and then apply standard bisimulation algorithms (see e.g. \cite{BisAlg,Piazza,Hopcroft}). 
The main practical limitation of this approach resides in the well--known state explosion problem, see e.g. \cite{StateExplosion2,StateExplosion1}.
This is the key reason for us to propose an alternative approach to check bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs which is centered on the notion of \textit{compositional bisimulation} that is introduced hereafter.
\begin{definition}
\label{Hbis}
Given a pair of Arenas 
 of FSMs , , ...,  (), a set 
\mbox{}, is a compositional bisimulation relation between  and  if for any  the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item ;
\item existence of  implies existence of  such that ;
\item existence of  implies existence of  such that .
\end{itemize}
The AFSMs  and  are compositionally bisimilar, denoted , if there exists a total compositional bisimulation relation between  and .
\end{definition}
The notion of compositional bisimulation is an equivalence relation on the class of AFSMs. The maximal compositional bisimulation relation between AFSMs  and  is a compositional bisimulation relation  such that  for any compositional bisimulation relation . The maximal compositional bisimulation exists and is unique. 
The set  is an equivalence relation on the collection of FSMs in . 
The quotient
of  induced by  is the minimal (in terms of the number of the FSMs involved) compositionally bisimilar AFSM of . The minimal AFSM of an AFSM , denoted , exists and is unique, up to isomorphisms. \\
Checking compositional bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs is equivalent to checking bisimulation equivalence of appropriate FSMs, as discussed hereafter. Consider a pair of AFSMs  (). 
Since bisimulation is an equivalence relation on the set  of FSMs, it induces a partition of  in  equivalence classes  where  if and only if . Note that  is a finite set. Define the tuple: 

where , , ,  is defined by  if , and  is such that 
 when . By definition of ,  if and only if .
The syntax of the tuple in (\ref{FSMarena}) is the same as the one of FSMs from which, the following result holds.
\begin{proposition}
\label{gio}
 if and only if . 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Definitions \ref{Bis} and \ref{Hbis}, it is readily seen that  if and only if the set 
 is a total bisimulation relation between  and . 
\end{proof}

We are now ready to present the main result of the paper, that shows that the notion of compositional bisimulation of AFSMs is consistent with the notion of bisimulation of the corresponding expanded FSMs. 
\begin{theorem}\label{prop}
If  then . 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let be  with   and 
 (, ). 
Set 
  (). Since , relation  is total. 
Consider the relation  defined by  with  and  if and only if  and . Consider . 
By definition of ,  for any  and . Hence one gets:

Note that the third equality in the above chain of equalities holds because  is total.
Hence, condition (i) in Definition \ref{Bis} is satisfied. Consider any transition  in . By definition of  there exist transitions  of  (), such that:

By definition of , for any  there exist transitions  of , with  and

Set:

and consider the transition   in . 
By definition of the relation  and by combining (\ref{fff}), (\ref{ccc}), (\ref{cccc}) and (\ref{ffff}), one gets  from which, together with condition (\ref{aaa}), one gets . 
Thus, condition (ii) in Definition \ref{Bis} is proved. Condition (iii) can be proven by using similar arguments. Finally condition (iv) holds by definition of . 
\end{proof}

The converse implication of the above result, i.e. whether  implies , is not true in general, as shown in the following counterexample. 
\begin{example}
Consider four FSMs  , where each  is characterized by the unique transition , where:

Consider a pair of AFSMs  and , depicted in Figure \ref{figcounterexample}, 
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,->,
shorten >=0.1pt,auto,node distance=1.65cm,thick,
inner sep=0.1 pt ,bend angle=30]
\tikzstyle{every state}=[minimum size=6mm,shape=rectangle]
\node[state, thin] (q_1) {};
\node[state, thin] (q_3) [ right of=q_1] {};
\node[state, thin] (q_2) [ right of=q_3] {};
\node[state, thin] (q_4) [ right of=q_2] {};
\node[state, thin] (q_5) [ right of=q_4] {};
\path[->, thin] 
(q_1) 
edge node [swap] {} (q_3)
(q_2) 
edge node {} (q_3)
(q_4) 
edge node {} (q_5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption[]{AFSM  in the left and AFSM  in the right.}
\label{figcounterexample}
\end{figure}
where:

It is easy to see that FSM  is composed by the unique transition:

with output function  defined by  and . Moreover, FSM  is characterized by the unique transition:

with output function  defined by  and . Hence, FSMs  and  are bisimilar. On the other hand, it is easy to see that FSM  is bisimilar to no FSM , . Hence,  and  are not compositionally bisimilar.
\end{example}


Theorem \ref{prop} can be used to reduce the size of AFSMs through compositional bisimulation, as follows. 
\begin{corollary}
\label{coro}
.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By definition of ,  and . Since , by Theorem \ref{prop}, .  
Hence,

that, by transitivity implies 
 
which, by Lemma \ref{lemma}, concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

The above result suggests a method to use compositional bisimulation for complexity reduction of AFSMs, as summarized in the following algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the relation .
\item Compute the quotient .
\item Expand the AFSM  to the FSM .
\item Compute the relation .
\item Compute the quotient . \end{itemize}

\section{Complexity analysis}

In this section we compare computational complexity in checking compositional bisimulation equivalence between AFSMs and bisimulation equivalence between the corresponding expanded FSMs. Consider a pair of AFSMs  composed of  FSMs and set  (). As common practice in the analysis of non--flat systems, e.g. \cite{StateExplosion2,StateExplosion1}, in the sequel we evaluate how computational complexity scales with the number  of FSMs in AFSMs . 
We start by evaluating the computational complexity in checking bisimulation equivalence of the flattened systems  and . As a direct application of Propositions \ref{prop21} and \ref{prop22}, one gets the following results.

\begin{corollary}
\label{prop23}
Space complexity in checking  is .
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
\label{prop24}
Time complexity in checking  is . 
\end{corollary}

The above result quantifies the aforementioned state explosion problem \cite{StateExplosion2,StateExplosion1} in the class of AFSMs. We now discuss computational complexity in checking compositional bisimulation. 
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop25}
Space complexity in checking  is .
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Direct consequence of Propositions \ref{prop21} and \ref{gio}. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop26}
Time complexity in checking  is . 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{gio}, checking  reduces to: (1) construct FSMs  and  and, (2) check if . 
Regarding (1), time complexity effort reduces to the one of defining functions  and  which amounts to 
. 
Regarding (2), by Proposition \ref{prop22}, time complexity in checking  is given by .
Since the last term is dominant over , the result follows. 
\end{proof}

Several mathematical models have been proposed in the control systems' and computer science literature to model genetic regulatory systems, see e.g. \cite{BioSurvey}, and the references therein. We recall directed and undirected graphs, bayesan, boolean and generalized logical networks in the class of discrete systems, and nonlinear, piecewise--linear, qualitative, partial differential equations in the class of continuous systems. Stochastic hybrid systems have been proposed in \cite{Julius:08}. These models can be broadly classified along two orthogonal mathematical paradigms: (i) discrete, vs. continuous, vs. hybrid models; (ii) deterministic, vs. non--deterministic, vs. stochastic models. AFSMs fall in the class of discrete non--deterministic systems. An exhaustive comparison of AFSMs with the aforementioned models is out of the scope of this section. We only mention that the discrete systems proposed in the literature well capture the network of the genes but lack in modeling the dynamics of each gene. 
In the following we show that AFSMs are appropriate to describe both the genes' network and the dynamics of each gene. Moreover, we show that the notion of  compositional bisimulation can lead to a sensible reduction in the size of the proposed model. \\
We consider the genetic regulatory system of the single--celled bacterium Escherichia Coli (\textit{E. coli}). In the sequel we only report basic facts about this regulatory system; the interested reader can refer to e.g. \cite{BiocBook,BiocBook1,Alon} for more details. 
\textit{E. coli} is a single--celled bacterium with a few million of proteins. During its life \textit{E. coli} encounters situations in which production of proteins is required. 
Each protein is produced by its gene. Each gene is a double strand of the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which encodes the information needed for the production of a specific protein. The transcription of a gene is the process by which  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase produces messenger RNA (mRNA) corresponding to the sequence of genetic code. The mRNA is then translated into a protein that is known as gene product. 
The genes whose activity is controlled in response to the needs of the cell, are called regulated genes. Regulated genes require special proteins called effectors or inductors which implement a kind of induction in the target gene. These proteins can bind to DNA and promote RNA transcription. 
When extracellular stimuli are perceived, such effectors promote RNA transcription and thus protein translation, as requested. 
Figure 4 describes a transcription network, representing about 10\% of the transcription interactions in \textit{E. coli}. Each node represents a gene. An edge (X,Y) indicates that the transcription factor encoded in X regulates operon Y. \\
\textit{E. coli} grows in moist soil containing salts which include a source of nitrogen, and a carbon source as glucose. 
The energy needed for biochemical reactions in \textit{E. coli} is derived from the metabolism of glucose and other secondary sugars including lactose, galactose and arabinose. For simplicity, in the following we focus on (only) the metabolic regulation of lactose, galactose and arabinose, see e.g. 
\cite{BiocBook1,BiocBook,Alon}. When lactose is the sole source of carbon in the soil, three proteins are synthesized, which are necessary to metabolize lactose: 
\begin{itemize}
\item --galactosidase (LacZ). This enzyme catalyzes splitting of lactose into glucose and galactose and catalyzes isomerization of lactose to allolactose.
\item	Lactose permease (LacY). It is located in the cytoplasmic membrane of \textit{E. coli} and is needed for the active transport of lactose into the cell.
\item Transacetylase (LacA). This enzyme modifies toxic molecules of lactose to facilitate their removal from the cell. 
\end{itemize}
When glucose is present, on average, only three molecules of --galactosidase are present in the cell. This is because the genes of the three proteins are repressed by a protein encoded by gene LacI. After entering into the cell, lactose is converted into allolactose through a biochemical reaction that is catalyzed by one of the few copies of --galactosidase. Then, allolactose binds to repressor LacI and after its dissociation, genes  LacZ, LacY and LacA are expressed, thus producing a 1000--fold increase in the concentration of --galactosidase. 
As already mentioned, for lactose to be metabolized, two conditions are needed: presence of lactose and absence of glucose. The latter is perceived by the cell via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that is a molecule whose concentration is inversely proportional to that of glucose. This molecule acts as a coactivator in respect of an activator protein, called cAMP receptor protein (CRP). When glucose is absent, the cAMP--CRP complex binds to a specific site near the promoter of the genes for LacZ, LacY and LacA and increases 50 times the transcription of their mRNA. 
Metabolic regulation of lactose can be formalized as an AFSM (see Figure 6 (Left Panel)) which involves proteins CRP, LacI, LacZ, LacY and LacA. 
We start by describing the FSM modeling the protein complex CRP--cAMP (Figure 5(a)). Complex CRP--cAMP switches from the inactive state  to the active state  when input , signaling absence of glucose, is perceived. As soon as glucose is perceived by the cell, the FSM switches to the initial state . 
Similarly we can represent the evolution of protein LacI. The corresponding FSM is depicted in Figure 5(c). It consists of three states: state , modeling that the protein is disabled, state , modeling activation of the protein, and state  modeling high activation of the protein. 
Transcribed proteins LacZ and LacY are illustrated in Figures 5(b)(d). We do not report the FSM of LacA because the mechanism by which LacA reacts to external stimuli is the same as the one of LacY; hence, we assume . 
If regulator proteins CRP and LacI are disabled, proteins LacZ and LacY are in their basal states  and , respectively. Both LacZ and LacY switch from states  and  to low transcription states ,  and respectively ,  if only one of proteins CRP and LacI are activated or equivalently, if either CRP is in state  or LacI is in state . Finally, LacZ and LacY switch to high transcription states  and  if both CRP and LacI are in states  and , respectively. Moreover, when LacZ is in state , it induces a transition in LacI from state  (modeling activation of protein LacI) to state  (modeling high activation of protein LacI). \\
The regulatory mechanism for the production of proteins capable of recruiting galactose and arabinose is similar to that of lactose. In particular, the galactose system involves proteins GalS, GalE, GalT, GalK. Figures 5(e)(f) reports FSM modeling of GalE and GalS respectively. FSMs of proteins GalT and GalK are not reported because the mechanism by which proteins GalT and GalK react to external stimuli is the same as the one of GalE, from which we assume . 
The arabinose system involves proteins AraA, AraB, AraC, AraD, AraE, AraF, AraG and AraK. 
Figures 5(g)(h)(i) reports FSM modeling of AraB, AraE and AraC respectively. FSMs of proteins AraA, AraC, AraD, AraF and AraG are not reported because the external behavior of proteins AraE, AraF, AraG and AraH can be considered as equivalent, which implies ; similarly, the external behavior of proteins AraB, AraA and AraD can be considered as equivalent, which implies . 
The obtained AFSM  is reported in Figure 6 (left panel). \\ 
We conclude this section by computing the minimal bisimilar FSM of  through the algorithm illustrated in Section 4.1: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item The relation  has been computed and the induced equivalence classes are: , , , , , , ,  and  . 
\item The quotient  has been computed and is illustrated in Figure 6 (right panel). 
\item By expanding  the FSM  is obtained, which consists of  states. 
\item The relation  is the identity relation.
\item The quotient  coincides with .
\end{itemize}
The above computations required to run bisimulation algorithms on the collection of FSMs  composing , whose sets of states sum up to  states, and the FSM  induced by , whose states are . A naive approach to compute , would apply bisimulation algorithms directly to , which is composed of  states. 

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we introduced the class of Arenas of Finite State Machines. We also proposed the notion of compositional bisimulation that 
provides a method to assess bisimulation equivalence between AFSMs, without the need of expanding them to the corresponding FSMs and hence, without incurring in the state explosion problem. Future research direction is two--fold. From the theoretical point of view, we will focus on generalizations of the results presented here to non--flat systems exhibiting more general compositional features, as both parallel and sequential composition. From the point of view of the systems' biology application that we proposed, we will investigate the use of AFSMs for the formal analysis of such systems.
