In the previous section, we have
seen how to construct an -partition of the
dynamic programming grid . Once this partition has been
built, the first step of the block edit-distance procedure is
to construct a repository of  tables corresponding to
each block of the partition. In this section we discuss how to
construct this repository of  tables efficiently.

We will be building the  tables by utilizing the process
of merging two  tables. That is, if  and  are
two  tables, one between a pair of substrings  and
 and the other between  and , then we refer to the
 table between  and  as the product of
\emph{merging}  and . For an arbitrary scoring
function, merging two   tables requires 
time using  iterations of the SMAWK algorithm discussed in
Section~\ref{Section: Block Edit-Distance via SLPs}. For the
rational scoring function, a recent important result of
Tiskin~\cite{Tiskin2009} shows how using the succinct
representation of  tables, two  tables can be
merged in  time.

Recall that the -partitioning step described in
Section~\ref{Section: Constructing the x-partition}
associates SLP variables with substrings in  and . Each
substring which is associated with a variable is of length
. There are two types of associated substrings: Those
whose associated SLP variable derives them exactly, and those
whose associated variable derives a superstring of them. As a first step, we construct the
 tables between any pair of substrings  and  in
 and  that are associated with a pair of SLP variables,
and are of the first type.
This is done in a recursive manner. We first construct
the  four  tables that correspond to
the pairs , , , and
, where  and  (resp.  and ) are the strings derived by the left and right
children of 's (resp. 's) associated variable.
We then merge these four s together
to obtain a  between  and .


Now assume  is a substring in  of the second type, and
we want to construct the  between  and a substring
 in . For simplicity assume that  is a substring of
the first type. Then, the variable associated with  is a
variable of the form  on a path between some two key
vertices  and .
For each ,
let  denote the substring associated with  . Notice that  is the concatenation of  and the substring  that is derived from 's right child.
The 
between  and  is thus constructed by first recursively
constructing the  between  and ,
and then merging this with the  between  and .
The latter already being available since the variables associated with  and  are of the first type.









\begin{lemma}
\label{Lemma: dist repository rational}Building the  repository under a rational scoring function
can be done in  time.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Recall that for rational scoring functions, merging two
succinct s of size  each requires 
time~\cite{Tiskin2009}. We perform exactly one merge per each
distinct pair of substrings in  and  induced by the
-partition. Since each substring is associated with a unique
SLP variable, there can only be  distinct
substring pairs. Thus, we get that only  merges of
succinct s need to be performed to create our
repository, hence we achieve the required bound. \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{Lemma: dist repository arbitrary}Building the  repository under an arbitrary scoring
function can be done in  time.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
In the case of arbitrary scoring functions, merging two
  tables requires  time. The same
upper bound shown above of  merges may be performed in
this case as well, and therefore we achieve the required bound.
\qed
\end{proof}
