\section{About granularity}
\label{sec:disc_gran}

Is it possible to create representations that discriminate between classes finer than the available coarse labels?  
Considering that we have seen only coarse labels at training time, how can we exploit the coarse classifier for fine-grained classification, if useful at all? 
In this section we discuss these two questions and construct an experiment to analyze the role of the losses and of the coarse classifier. 
We then provide empirical observations. 

\paragraph{Practical setup. } 

In the following two experiments, we consider the CIFAR-100 benchmark that has two granularity levels with 20 and 100 classes (see Section \ref{sec:dataset}).

We denote by $f$ the Resnet-18 trunk mapping from the image space to an embedding space. 
We train the neural network trunk $f$ with three possible losses: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Baseline: regular cross-entropy classification training $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE}$ with coarse or fine classes; 
    \item
    Triplet loss: training a triplet loss $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Triplet}$ to differentiate between image instances (does not use the labels);
    \item
    $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE} + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Triplet}$: sum of the two losses. 
    This is intended to be a simple proxy of \ours.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Experiment: separating arbitrary fine labels}  
\label{sec:analysis}

This experiment is inspired both by the Rademacher complexity \cite{Boucheron2005Rademacher} and by the self-supervised learning (SSL) literature \cite{Berthelot2019ReMixMatchSL}.  
In SSL, the standard way to evaluate the quality of a feature extractor $f$ is to measure the accuracy of the network after learning a linear classifier $l$ for the target classes on top of $f$. 
The Rademacher complexity measures how a  class of functions (\textit{i.e.} $l\circ f$, with $f$ fixed and $l$ learned) is able to classify a set of images with random binary labels.

For this experiment we train the trunk $f$ jointly with a (coarse class) classifier with $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE}$ using coarse labels.
We hope to improve the granularity of $f$, i.e. improve the network trunk such that a (finer-grained) classifier $l$ trained on top of $f$ performs better at discriminating between instances that have the same coarse label. 

    \begin{table}[t]
    \caption{Separability experiment on CIFAR-100.  
    The trunk is trained with coarse labels only. 
    Images with the same coarse label are randomly grouped into two distinct fine-grain labels (40 distinct labels in total).  
    Then we fine-tune a linear classifier on this synthetic labels and measure the top-1 accuracy on fine-labels.  
    When conditioning, the estimator exploits the hierarchy: we first predict the coarse class and condition on it to make the final prediction. We report results with three training losses.\label{tab:rademacher_complexity_v2}}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
    \toprule
    Training &  \multicolumn{2}{c}{Top-1 (\%)} \\
    loss & no cond. & coarse cond. \\
    \midrule 
    $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE}$ & 
        53.7~\stdminus{0.3} & 54.5~\stdminus{0.3} \\
    $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Triplet}$ & 
        26.4~\stdminus{0.3} & --- \\
    $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE} +\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Triplet}$   &
        57.1~\stdminus{0.2} & \textbf{58.5}~\stdminus{0.3} \\
    \midrule
    Random network & 8.7~\stdminus{0.3} & --- \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}


 


\paragraph{Random labels.}

We generate synthetic fine labels by the following process:
for each coarse label, we randomly and evenly split the training images into two subcategories, yielding 40 classes in total. 
Inspired by the empirical Rademacher estimation, we sample 10 distinct splits of random labels. 
For each split,  we learn a linear classifier $l$ on top of $f_i$.  
We then compute the mean accuracy (top-1, \%) of $l \circ f_i$ on the training examples for the three losses.  By evaluating to what extent one can fit a linear classifier $l$ on top of $f$,
this experiment measures how well the data are spread in the representation spaces. 

\paragraph{Impact of the loss terms.}

We report the results in Table~\ref{tab:rademacher_complexity_v2}.
We can see that, to distinguish between our synthetic fine labels, training with the triplet loss $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Triplet}$ in combination with the classification loss $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE}$ is essential: the sum of losses outperforms each individual loss.


\paragraph{Conditioning.}

We also measure the impact of \emph{conditioning on coarse classes}: we first predict the coarse label with the coarse classifier, and leverage its softmax output to classify the fine class. 
This clearly improves the accuracy, which motivates our fusion strategy inspired by this conditioning in Section~\ref{sec:categoryretrieval}.

\subsection{Experiment: varying the training granularity}

In this section we make empirical observations related to the training granularity in the embedding space. 

We train $f$ with one of the three losses and either coarse or fine labels as supervision. 
In a second stage, we train a linear classifer $l$ on the Resnet-18 trunk with fine class supervision, and evaluate its accuracy on the test set.

\paragraph{Accuracies.}

We first quantify the quality of the representation space. 
The accuracies are reported in Table~\ref{tab:analysis_training_schemes}. 
We observe that the coarse labels are almost as good as the fine labels as a pre-training. 
The unsupervised $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Triplet}$ loss performs significantly worse, which concurs with our previous separability experiment. 
Combining this loss with the $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE}$ loss improves is, both with coarse and fine supervisions.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{

We report the results after finetuning of the linear classifier on the fine labels (see Section~\ref{sec:disc_gran}).

\end{table} 


\paragraph{Size of the representation space.}
\label{sec:size_space}

We quantify the information content of embedding vectors by computing their principal components analysis (PCA).
This is a reasonable proxy for information content given that the features are separated by linear classifiers afterwards. 
We observe the cumulative energy of the PCA components ordered by decreasing energy.
We assume that a more uniform energy distribution (and thus lower curves) means that the representation is richer, since a few vector components cannot summarize it. 


\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{\label{fig:pca_energy}
 Cumulative energy of the PCA decomposition of CIFAR-100 image embeddings, depending on the granularity of the training labels (20 or 100  classes). 
}
\end{figure} 
Figure~\ref{fig:pca_energy} shows the results.
When training with $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{CE}$ loss, the most uniform distribution for the principal components is obtained for the fine supervision. This is expected since it is a finer-grain separation of entities and that can not be summarized with a  subspace as small as the one associated with a relatively small number of categories.
Notice that the training granularity (20 or 100 classes) can be read as an inflexion point on the PCA decomposition curves.
The loss $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Triplet}$ is not very informative on its own but does improve the cross-entropy representation when combined with it.


\paragraph{Discussion.}

This simple preliminary experiment shows that the label granularity has a strong impact on very basic statistics of the embedding distribution. 
It is the basic intuition behind \ours: a rich representation can be obtained using just coarse labels, if we combine them with a self-supervised loss.

 
\section{Additions to the experiments}
\label{app:experiment}

This section details the training procedure of \ours and provides more extensive experimental results.


\subsection{Training settings}

\label{app:train_settings}
As described in the main part, 
our training procedure is inspired by Tong et al.~\cite{Tong2018BagofTricks}:
 we use SGD with Nesterov momentum and cosine learning rates decay.
 We follow  Goyal et al.'s~\cite{Goyal2017AccurateLM} recommendation for the  learning rate magnitude: $\mathrm{lr}=\frac{0.1}{256} \times \mathrm{batch size}$.
 The augmentations include random resized crop, RandAugment~\cite{Cubuk2019RandAugmentPA} and Erasing~\cite{Zhong2020RandomED}.
 We train for 600 epochs with batches of 1024 images of resolution $224\times 224$ pixels  (except for CIFAR-100 where the resolution is $32\times 32$).
 For \ours with $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{inst}$ we use $T=4$ different data-augmentations on ImageNet and $T=8$ on CIFAR-100.
 For the supervised loss we use one data-augmentation in order to have the same training procedure as our supervised baseline.

\paragraph{Weighting of the losses.}
\label{sec:lossweight}

We investigate the impact of weighting the losses  $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{knn}$ and $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{inst}$. 
For example, on CIFAR-100 classification, Table~\ref{tab:weighting_comparison} shows that an equal weighting gives the best or near-best results. 
Therefore, to avoid adding a hyper-parameter and in order to simplify the method, we chose to not use weighting, \emph{i.e.} we just sum up the two losses.

   \begin{table}[t]
    \caption{Category-level (mAP, \%) and one-the-fly kNN classification (top-1, \%)  performance in a coarse-to-fine setting on CIFAR-100 with different loss weighting. Our total loss is $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{tot}(x)= \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{knn}(g_{\theta}(x),y) +  \lambda \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{inst}(x)$ with $\lambda$ being a real-valued coefficient.

    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}}}
    \end{table} 
\paragraph{A strong Baseline.}

Our training procedure improves the ResNet-50 performance and thus is a strong baseline against which we can compare \ours.
Therefore, Table~\ref{tab:resnet_50_baseline} compares our baseline on ImageNet with other ResNet-50 training procedures.
We observe that our training procedure gives better results than many other approaches. 
This makes it possible to isolate the contribution of our improved training practices and that of the \ours loss.

\subsection{\{coarse,fine\}-to-\{coarse,fine\}: evaluation}
\label{subsec:eval_fc}

We compare our main baselines and \ours's performance in the 4 following scenarios: coarse-to-coarse, coarse-to-fine, fine-to-fine and fine-to-coarse.
The evaluations are performed with two classifiers: a \knn classifier (kNN) and a linear classifier fine-tuned (FT) with a cross-entropy loss on top of the embeddings. 

The results in Table~\ref{tab:baselines_full} show that \ours training improves the accuracy in almost all settings, including the fine-to-fine setting, which is just regular classification with the vanilla labels for Imagenet.



    \begin{table}[t]
    \caption{Performance comparison (top-1 accuracy) when learning and testing at different granularities (ResNet50).

    We report the results of both the kNN classifier and of a linear classifier fine-tuned with the target granularity (FT).

\subsection{Coarse-to-Fine with different taxonomic rank}
\label{sec:table_inat}

\paragraph{Datasets.} We carry out evaluations on iNaturalist-2018, and with iNaturalist-2019~\cite{Horn2019INaturalist}, which is a subset of iNaturalist-2018~\cite{Horn2018INaturalist} where  classes with too few images have been removed. 
iNaturalist 2019 dataset is thus composed of 268,243 images divided into 1,010 classes at the finest level. From the coarse to the finest level, we have 3 classes for Kingdom, 4 classes for Phylum, 9 classes for Class, 34 classes for Order, 57 classes for Family, 72 classes for Genus and 1,010 classes for Species.

\paragraph{Results.}
We report exhaustive results with our two coarse-to-fine evaluation protocols with all our baselines on iNaturalist-2018~\cite{Horn2018INaturalist} and iNaturalist-2019~\cite{Horn2019INaturalist} in Table~\ref{tab:INaturalist_Results}.

We comment more specifically the \knn classification accuracy (left) because for retrieval, \ours outperform all the baselines by a large margin. 
The table on the right is divided in 10 matrices each containing results for one combination of a method and a dataset (iNaturalist 2018 or 2019).

The diagonal values in the matrices correspond to a traditional setting where the training and the test granularity are the same.
Even in this case, the \ours descriptors outperforms the baseline methods most often. 
On iNaturalist 2018, for Species, the finest and most challenging level, the additional \ours loss improves the top-1 accuracy by 7\% absolute.
The gain is more marginal for iNaturalist 2019 (+0.9\%), which shows that \ours is especially useful for unbalanced class distributions where some classes are in a low-shot training regime.

The lower triangle of each matrix reports the coarse-to-fine results, which is the setting in which we focus in our paper. 
\ours obtains the best results for most combinations, with accuracy gains of around 10 points with respect to the baseline and by a few points for ClusterFit+. 
It is interesting to look at the $\varnothing$ column, which is the  unsupervised case. 
In that case, the baseline training reduces to a random network, but \ours is able to extract signal from the \knn loss.

The upper triangle is the fine-to-coarse setting, where finer labels are available for the training images than what is used at test time. 
This is obviously not the setting of the paper but it is worth discussing these results. 
A natural baseline for fine-to-coarse is to discard the fine labels and train only with the coarse labels induced by the fine annotation. 
This would yield the same accuracy as on the corresponding entry of the diagonal of the matrix. 
Irrespective of the method, the fine-to-coarse training does not necessarily outperform this simple strategy.

\subsection{Transfer Learning Tasks}
\label{app:tl}

This section details the experimental settings for the transfer learning and reports more results and comparisons.

\paragraph{Fine-tuning settings}
As described in Section~\ref{subsec:transfer_learning_task} 
We initialize the network trunk with ImageNet pre-trained weights and fine-tune only the classifier. 
For our method, the pre-trained network trunk $f_\theta$ remains fixed. 
The projector $P_\theta$ is discarded. 
For all methods we fine-tune during 240 epochs with a cosine learning rate schedule starting at 0.01, and batches of 512 images.

For fine-tuning results in Table~\ref{tab:transfer_learning_tasks_sota}  we additionally use Cutmix~\cite{Yun2019CutMix} and FixRes~\cite{Touvron2019FixRes} during fine-tuning and we fine-tune with more epochs (1000 for Flowers~\cite{Nilsback08} and Cars~\cite{Cars2013}, 300 for Food-101~\cite{bossard14Food101} and iNaturalist~\cite{Horn2018INaturalist,Horn2019INaturalist}). These choices improve the performance for all the methods.

\paragraph{Results.}
Table~\ref{tab:transfer_learning_task_diverse_arch} compares the performance obtained with \ours for different architectures. 
We report results with \ours topped with either a multi-layers perceptron (MLP) or a linear classifier (FC).
The accuracy increases for larger models. 
This shows that, although ResNet-50 serves as a running example architecture for \ours, the method applies without modifications to other architectures. 

Table~\ref{tab:transfer_learning_tasks} compares the performances= obtained with \ours and baselines with MLP and FC classifier.
For all settings, the flexibility of the MLP is useful to outperform the linear classifier (FC). 
The transfer learning results are better or as good for \ours variants. 
The gap with the baseline methods is higher for the iNaturalist variants. 
This is because the datasets are more challenging, as evidenced by the relatively low accuracies reported.

\section{Visualization}
\label{app:visu}

\paragraph{CIFAR.}

Figure~\ref{fig:sampleranking} shows for a giving test image in CIFAR-100 the 10 nearest neighbours in the training according the cosine similarity in the embedding space.
In Figure~\ref{fig:sampleranking} models  are trained on the 20 CIFAR-100 coarse classes.
The correct classes are indicated in green.
For example, in the first row, \ours correctly identifies a butterfly query in 9 out of 10 results, while the baseline method succeeds only 5 times. 
The second row is a relative failure case, because \ours confuses a van with a pickup truck. 
However, it correctly matches the colors of the vehicles. 

\paragraph{iNaturalist.}

Figure~\ref{fig:inat_ranking_evolution_appendix_1}, ~\ref{fig:inat_ranking_evolution_appendix_2} and Figure~\ref{fig:inat_ranking_evolution_appendix_3} present similar results for three examples for iNaturalist-2018, but with several levels of granularity for the training set, which allow one to vizualize the importance of the training granularity as well.  
Each granularity level is identified with a color. 
The frame color around the image indicates which at which granularity the match is correct: for example, light orange means it is correct at the order level and green means that the result is correct at the finest granularity (Species).

We can observe from the colors and the image content that the level at which \ours is correct is almost systematically better than the baseline\footnote{These examples are representative of typical comparisons, as we have not cherry-picked to show cases where our method is better. }. 
For example, the baseline model trained at the genus granularity in Figure~\ref{fig:inat_ranking_evolution_appendix_1} matches the deer query with a moose (rank 3). 

In Figure~\ref{fig:inat_ranking_evolution_appendix_2}, the butterfly is matched relatively easily with other butterflies by both classifiers, even when they are trained with coarse granularity. 
This is because butterflies have quite distinctive textures. 
However, \ours slightly outperforms the baseline for finer granularity levels. 

Figure~\ref{fig:inat_ranking_evolution_appendix_3} shows an orca query, which is quite distinctive with its black-and-white skin. 
The baseline method is unable to distinguish it from other marine mammals, even when trained at the finest granularity. 
\ours is able to distinguish these textures more accurately, so it gets perfect retrieval results even when trained at the genus granularity.

\caption{CIFAR-100: For given test images (\textit{top}), we present the ranked list of train images that are most similar with embeddings obtained with a baseline method (top) and our method (bottom) train with coarse labels.
Images in \textcolor{green}{green} indicate that the image belongs to the correct fine class; \textcolor{orange}{orange} indicates the correct coarse class  but incorrect fine class. 
In this example, all results are correct w.r.t. coarse granularity.
