Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single ``Crazy in Love", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song ``Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" and the top-five songs ``If I Were a Boy" and ``Halo". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, ``Halo"'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful ``Sweet Dreams", and singles ``Diva", ``Ego", ``Broken-Hearted Girl" and ``Video Phone". The music video for ``Single Ladies" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the ``first major dance craze" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's ``You Belong with Me", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech. In March 2009, Beyoncé embarked on the I Am... World Tour, her second headlining worldwide concert tour, consisting of 108 shows, grossing \16.

Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with out current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them.

\cellcolor{oldlace} Write a scientific title for the following abstract: OBJECTIVES Sepsis is characterised by the frequent presence of organ failure and marked immunologic alterations. We studied the association between the extent of organ failure and the transcriptomic response of septic patients. METHODS Gene expression profiles in the blood of 74 surgical patients with sepsis were compared with those of 30 surgical patients with no sepsis. Differentially expressed genes were assessed for their correlation with the sequential organ failure (SOFA) score. RESULTS The expression levels of a group of genes participating in the cell cycle (HIST1H1C, CKS2, CCNA2, CDK1, CCNB2, CIT, CCNB1, AURKA, RAD51), neutrophil protease activity (ELANE, ADORA3, MPO, MMP8, CTSG), IL-1R and IL-18R response correlated directly with SOFA and mortality. Genes involved in T cell (LCK, CD3G, CD3D, ZAP70, ICOS, CD3E, CD28, IL2RB, CD8B, CD8A, CD40LG, IL23A, CCL5, SH2D1A, ITK, CD247, TBX21, GATA3, CCR7, LEF1, STAT4) and NK cell immunity (CD244, KLRK1, KLRD1) were inversely associated with SOFA and mortality. CONCLUSIONS The extent of organ failure in sepsis correlates directly with the existence of imbalanced innate and adaptive responses at the transcriptomic level. Quantification of the expression levels of the genes identified here could contribute to the simultaneous assessment of disease severity and immunological alterations in sepsis.\vspace{1pt} \newline Title: \textcolor{cadmiumgreen}{Transcriptomic correlates of organ failure extent in sepsis.} \\
