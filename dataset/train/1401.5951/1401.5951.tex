\begin{abstract}
  Champarnaud and Ziadi, and Khorsi \emph{et al.} show how to compute the equation automaton of word regular expression  \emph{via} the -C-Continuations.
  Kuske and Meinecke extend the computation of the equation automaton to a regular tree expression  over a ranked alphabet  and produce a  time and space complexity algorithm, where  is the maximal rank of a symbol  occurring  in  and  is the size of . In this paper, we give a full description of the algorithm based on the acyclic minimization of Revuz. Our algorithm, which is performed in an  time and space complexity, where  is the number of states of the produced automaton, is more efficient than the one obtained by Kuske and Meinecke.

\section{Introduction}

Regular expressions, which are finite representatives of potentially infinite languages, are widely used in various application areas such as XML Schema Languages~\cite{xml}, logic and verification~\cite{verif}, \emph{etc.} The concept of word regular expressions  has been extended to tree regular expressions. Similarly to word expressions, one can convert them into  finite recognizers, the tree automata.
 
 The study of the different  ways of conversion of regular expressions into automata and \emph{vice versa} is a very  active  field. There exists a lot  of techniques to transform regular expressions (resp. regular tree expressions)  into finite automata~\cite{Brug,glushkov,khorsi,ZPC} (resp. into finite tree automata~\cite{automate2,lata}). As far as tree automata are concerned, computation algorithms are extensions of word cases. In~\cite{lata}, the computation of the position tree automaton from  a regular tree expression has been achieved by extending the classical notions of Glushkov functions defined  in~\cite{glushkov}, leading to the computation of an automaton which number of states is linear w.r.t. the number of  occurrences of symbols but which number of transitions can be exponential. In the same paper, it is proved that this automaton can be reduced  into a quadratic size recognizer.
 
 On the other side, Kuske and Meinecke have extended the notion of  word partial derivatives~\cite{antimirov} into  tree partial derivatives. They also present how to compute them extending  from words to trees~\cite{automate2} the -C-Continuation algorithm by Champarnaud and Ziadi~\cite{ZPC1}. They obtain an algorithm with  space and time complexity where  is the maximal rank of a symbol  occurring  in the finite ranked alphabet  and  is the size of the regular expression.

In this paper, we show how to extend a notion of -C-Continuation in order to compute from a regular tree expression its equation tree automaton  with an  time and space complexity where  is the number of its states. This constitutes an improvement in comparison with  Kuske and Meinecke algorithm~\cite{automate2}. The paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec prelim} outlines finite tree automata over ranked trees, regular tree expressions, and linearized regular tree expressions which allows the set of positions to be defined. Next, in Section~\ref{sec tree automata} the notions of derivation and partial derivative of regular expression and set of regular expressions are 
introduced. Thus the definitions of equation tree automaton and -C-Continuation tree automaton associated with the regular expression  is obtained. Afterwards, in Section~\ref{sec:algo} we present our algorithm which builds the equation tree automaton with an  time and space complexity. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:exemple} provides a full example of our construction.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec prelim}

    Let  be  \emph{a ranked alphabet}, where  is a finite set and  represents the  \emph{rank} of  which is a mapping from  into . The set of symbols of rank  is denoted by . The elements of rank  are called  \emph{constants}.

A regular expression  defined over  is  \emph{linear} if and only if every symbol of  appears at most once in . Note that any constant symbol may occur more than once. Let  be a regular expression over . The  \emph{linearized regular expression}  in  of a regular expression  is obtained from  by marking differently all symbols of a rank  greater than or equal to  (symbols of ). The set of  \emph{marked symbols} with symbols of  is the ranked alphabet  containing symbols called  \emph{positions}. We denote this set by . When there is no ambiguity we denote by  the subexpression  with  is a subexpression  of .
The mapping  is defined from  to  with  for every  . It associates with a marked symbol  the symbol  and for a symbol  the symbol .

\section{Tree Automata Computations}\label{sec tree automata}

In this section, we recall how to compute from a regular expression  a tree automaton that accepts . We first recall the computation of the equation automaton  of , then we define the -c-continuation automaton .

\subsection{The Equation Tree Automaton}

  In \cite{automate2}, Kuske and Meinecke extend the notion of word partial derivatives \cite{antimirov} to tree partial derivatives in order to compute from a regular expression  a tree automaton recognizing . Due to the notion of  ranked alphabet, partial derivatives are no longer sets of expressions, but sets of tuples of expressions.
  
Let  be a tuple of regular expressions,  be some regular expression and . Then  is the tuple . For  a set of tuples of regular expressions,  is the set . Finally,  and .

\begin{definition}[\cite{automate2}]
  Let  be a regular expression over a ranked alphabet  and  be a symbol in  with  an integer.  The set  of tuples of regular expressions is defined as follows:

	\centerline{ 
	 \begin{tabular}{r@{\ }l}
      & 
     \\
      & \\
      & 
     \\  
      & \\
	 \end{tabular}
	}
   
  The function  is extended to any set  of regular expressions as follows:
  
  \centerline{ .}
\end{definition}



The  \emph{partial derivative} of  w.r.t. a word , denoted by , is the set of regular expressions inductively defined by: 
  
  \centerline{
  
}

\noindent The partial derivation is extended to any subset  of  as 
by .
Note that . 


\begin{definition}\label{def aut eq}
  Let  be a regular expression over a ranked alphabet . The  \emph{Equation  Automaton} of  is the tree automaton  defined by , , and
  
  \centerline{}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{automate2}]
Let  be a regular expression and  be the equation tree automaton associated with . Then
 .
\end{theorem}
\subsection{The C-Continuation Tree Automaton}

In~\cite{automate2}, Kuske and Meinecke show how to efficiently compute the equation tree automaton of a regular expression \emph{via} an extension of Champarnaud and Ziadi's 
-C-Continuation~\cite{ZPC1,ZPC2,khorsi}. In this section, we show how to inductively compute them. The main difference with~\cite{automate2} is that the -c-continuations are here computed using alternative formulae, and not using the partial derivation. As a consequence, any symbol that appears in the expression  admits a non-empty -c-continuation (\emph{e.g.} in~\cite{automate2}, there is no continuation for  in ). 

\begin{definition}\label{def1}
 Let  be linear. Let  and  be two integers such that . Let  be in . The  \emph{-C-continuation}  of  in  is the regular expression defined by:
 
\centerline{
  \begin{tabular}{r@{\ }l}
     & 
      \\
     & 
    \\
     & 
    \\
     & \\
  \end{tabular}
}

 By convention, we set . 
\end{definition}

Let us first show the relation between partial derivation and -c-continuation.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem f cgk cf}

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction over the structure of . For any symbol  and for any expression , let us set

    \end{enumerate} 
    \item Let us suppose that . Two cases have to be considered:

      \item Suppose that . Then . Depending whether  belongs to , either   or .  Since , it holds by induction hypothesis that either   or . Finally, since  for any integer , , in both of these cases, .
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
 \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop f deriv u cf}

\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

   \item Let . Then . By definition, . According to Lemma~\ref{lem f cgk cf}, .
   \item Let  with  a word in  and  a symbol in . Then . According to recurrence hypothesis, it holds that . By definition, . According to Lem\-ma~\ref{lem f cgk cf}, for any integer  such that , it holds  . Since , there exists at least one integer  such that . Consequently, .
 \end{enumerate}
 \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def aut c cont lin}
The automaton  is defined by  
 \begin{itemize}
 \item ,
\item 
\end{itemize}
where for any symbol  in , .
\end{definition}

The following lemma illustrates the link between  and .

\begin{lemma}\label{lemme3}
The coaccessible part of   is equal to .
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
  The expression  is the final state of the two automata. Let us suppose now that  is a coaccessible state both in  and . Hence, from Definition~\ref{def aut c cont lin} and from Definition~\ref{def aut eq}: 
  
  \centerline{
    \begin{tabular}{l@{\ }l}
      & there exists a transition  in \\
        &   \\
        &  (Proposition~\ref{prop f deriv u cf})\\
        & there exists a transition  in .\\
    \end{tabular}
  }
  
  Hence, the states  are coaccessible from  by  in  if and only if they are in . Consequently, the 
  coaccessible part of   is equal to the equation tree automaton .
 \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The automaton  accepts .
\end{corollary}

The  \emph{C-Continuation tree automaton}  associated with  is obtained by replacing each transition   of the tree automaton  by .

\begin{corollary}
.  
\end{corollary}

In what follows, for any two trees  and , we denote by  the relation " is a subtree of ". Let  be an integer. We denote by  the root of any tree  and by , for a tree , the  child of  in  that is root of  if it exists.

\subsection{From -C-Continuation Automaton to Equation Automaton}

The equation automaton is a quotient of the C-Continuation one

  Let  be a transition in . Equivalently by construction, there exists a symbol  such that  is a transition in the accessible part of the automaton . As the coaccessible part of  and  are equal (by Lemma~\ref{lemme3}), the transition  is in the automaton  with  for ; consequently .  From Proposition~\ref{prop aut eq}, it is equivalent to . Thus  is a transition in the automaton .

\section{Construction of the equation tree automaton }\label{sec:algo}

In~\cite{automate2}, the computation of the -C-Continuations requires a preprocessing step which is the identification of subexpression of  in  time and space complexity. We propose an algorithm for the computation of the set of states with an  time and space complexity.

\subsection{Computation of the set of states }

The main idea is to efficiently compute the quotient  by converting the syntax tree into a finite acyclic deterministic word automaton. 

Let  be the syntax tree associated with

\noindent \begin{minipage}{0.6\linewidth}
	In order to identify the equivalent -C-Continuations, we can sort them in lexicographic order. 
This can be done in  time and space complexity using Paige and Tarjan's Algorithm~\cite{tarjan}. 
This is due to the fact that the size of -C-Continuations is in  (by Corollary~\ref{corol}). This complexity has been improved by 
 using \emph{-Pseudo-Continuations} instead of -C-Continuations~\cite{ZPC1,khorsi}.

  From Proposition~\ref{prop1} we can deduce that the -C-Continuations identification can be achieved by considering the -Pseudo-Continuations. In the following we show that this identification step (computation of ) can be done without the computation of the -Pseudo-Continuations and  that it amounts to the minimization of a word acyclic deterministic automaton. Before seeing how the identification of -Pseudo-Continuations  is performed, we prove that the computation of the function  can be done in a linear time in the size of . 

Let us consider the syntax tree  associated with

 This syntax tree contains all the subexpressions of . Each node  in  corresponds to the 
subexpression  of . The equivalence relation  over the nodes of the tree  is defined by . We show that the computation of the equivalence relation  amounts to the minimization of the word acyclic deterministic automaton , where  is the node associated to the root of ,  with , , and  is defined by  if ,  and  if ,  if ,  if , and  in all otherwise.

      \item Otherwise, there exists an integer  such that ,  and . By induction over the size of .
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item If , then since the roots are distincts, the word starting with the symbol associated to the node  followed by the symbol  is in  but not in .
        \item Otherwise, it holds by induction hypothesis that there exists a word in  not in . Hence there exists a word starting with a symbol associated to the node  followed by a word in  that is in  but not in .

The computation of a transition rule using Proposition~\ref{prop2} requires a linear time, according to Proposition~\ref{prop tps lin pour follow}. Then for all transition rules we get an  time and space complexity where  is the set of C-Continuations of . 
The computation of the set of states  make possible the creation of non-coaccessible states. Removing these states requires an  time complexity.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented a new and more efficient algorithm for the computation of the equation tree automaton from a regular tree expression by extending the notion of -c-continuation from words to trees. We proved that a regular tree expression  can be converted into an equation tree automaton with an  time and space complexity 
where  is the set of -C-Continuations of .
