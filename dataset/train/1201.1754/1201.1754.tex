\begin{abstract}
  One of the most interesting questions concerning hierarchical control of discrete-event systems with partial observations is a condition under which the language observability is preserved between the original and the abstracted plant. Recently, we have characterized two such sufficient conditions---observation consistency and local observation consistency. In this paper, we prove that the condition of observation consistency is undecidable for non-regular (linear, deterministic context-free) languages. The question whether the condition is decidable for regular languages is open.

\section{Introduction}
  The main issue in supervisory control of discrete-event systems~\cite{CL08} is the state-space explosion problem inherent to large systems, which makes the standard techniques that compute and use the whole system model very difficult and often impossible to use. Methods how to decrease the complexity are intensively studied in the literature. Modular control and hierarchical control are the most successful approaches known so far. These two approaches are complementary because the modular approach can be understood as a horizontal modularity, while the hierarchical approach can be understood as a vertical modularity. The best known results are achieved when the two approaches are combined~\cite{KS}. 
  
  During the last few decades, hierarchical control of discrete-event systems with complete observations has widely been investigated. Several important concepts---the {\em observer property\/} \cite{WW96}, {\em output control consistency\/} (OCC) \cite{WZ91}, and {\em local control consistency\/} (LCC) \cite{SB08}---have been proposed and studied. These concepts are sufficient conditions for the high-level synthesis of a nonblocking and optimal supervisor having a low-level implementation. Recently, we have addressed hierarchical control of partially observed discrete-event systems. In \cite{KM10}, we have presented a sufficient condition which ensures that the optimal high-level supervisor with partial observation is implementable in the original low-level plant. However, the condition imposes that all the observable events must be included in the high-level alphabet, which is very restrictive. Later, in \cite{cdc-ecc2011}, we have discussed a weaker, less restrictive condition, and we have introduced two new structural conditions for projections called {\em local observation consistency\/} (LOC) and {\em observation consistency\/} (OC). The latter addresses a certain consistency between observations on the high level and the low level, and the former is an extension of the observer property under partial observations. We have shown that projections which satisfy OC, LOC, LCC, and which are observers are also suitable for the nonblocking least restrictive hierarchical control under partial observation. However, we have left the question whether the conditions are decidable or not open. 
  
  In this paper, we prove that the condition of observation consistency is undecidable for non-regular (linear, deterministic context-free) languages. The motivation to study this case comes from the fact that although supervisory control of discrete-event systems is mostly developed for regular languages, several attempts of its generalization to deterministic context-free languages have appeared in the literature~\cite{gri07,gri10}. However, the fundamental problem whether the condition is decidable for regular languages is still unsolved.


\section{Preliminaries and definitions}
	In this paper, we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of supervisory control theory \cite{CL08} and automata and formal language theory \cite{salomaa}. For an alphabet , defined as a finite nonempty set,  denotes the free monoid generated by , where the unit of , the empty string, is denoted by . A {\em language\/} over  is a subset of . A {\em (natural) projection\/} , where  and  are alphabets, is a homomorphism defined so that  for , and  for . The {\em inverse image} of , denoted by , is defined as . These definitions can naturally be extended to languages. A string  is a {\em prefix} of a string  if , for some . The prefix closure  of a language  is the set of all prefixes of all its elements. A language  is prefix-closed if .

  In this paper, the notion of a generator is used to denote an incomplete deterministic finite automaton. A {\em generator\/}  is a quintuple , where  is a finite set of {\em states},  is an {\em input alphabet},  is a {\em partial transition function},  is the {\em initial state}, and  is the set of {\em final or marked states}. In the usual way,  is extended to a function from  to . The language {\em generated\/} by the generator  is defined as the set of all possible strings  can read from the initial state, that is, , and the language {\em marked\/} by the generator  is defined as the set of all strings leading  from the initial state to a marked state, that is, . Note that, by definition, , and  is always prefix-closed. Moreover, we use the predicate  to denote that the transition  is defined in . 

	Let  and  be two languages. The {\em parallel composition of  and \/} is defined as the language . For the corresponding automata definition, the reader is referred to~\cite{CL08}. 

  Let  be a generator over an alphabet , and let  be the subset of all uncontrollable events. A language  is {\em controllable} with respect to  and  if . Moreover,  is -closed if . Furthermore, let  be the subset of all controllable events, and let  be the set of all observable events with  as the corresponding projection from  to . The language  is {\em observable\/} with respect to , , and  if for all  such that  and for all , . Algorithms for these properties can be found in~\cite{CL08}.

  Given a system  over an alphabet  and a specification language , the aim of supervisory control is to find a nonblocking supervisor  such that the closed-loop system  satisfies the specification and is nonblocking, that is, ; as these notions are not important for the understanding of this paper, we do not discuss them here and refer the reader to~\cite{CL08,Won04} for more details. We only note that it is known that such a supervisor exists if and only if  is controllable with respect to  and , -closed, and observable with respect to , , and . 


\section{Observation consistency}
  Recently, we have studied the problem of an existence of supervisors under partial observation based on the computation of abstractions. In this framework, the plant is represented as a generator  over an alphabet  and it is desired to realize a high-level specification , where  is a high-level alphabet. Our recent result is recalled below as Theorem~\ref{thm3}. 
  
  For projections and abstractions, we use the following notations:
  ,
  ,
  , and
   as illustrated in the commutative diagram in Figure~\ref{projections}.

                & \ruTo^{A} &                 & \rdTo^{P_{hi}} & \\
      \Sigma^*  &           &                 &                & \relax \qquad (\Sigma_o\cap \Sigma_{hi})^* \\

                &           & \Sigma_{o}^*    &                & \\

  \begin{definition}[Observation consistency]\label{def:consistency}
    A language  is said to be {\em observation consistent} with respect to projections , , and  if for all strings  such that , there exist strings  such that , , and .
  \end{definition}  
  
  Thus, observation consistency requires that any two strings that have the same observation in the abstracted high-level plant have also corresponding strings with the same observation in the original low-level plant.

  The other condition required for the next theorem is the local observation consistency.
  \begin{definition}[Local observation consistency]\label{def:loc}
    A language  is said to be {\em locally observation consistent} with respect to projections , , and the set of controllable events  if for all strings   and events  such that , , and , there exist  such that  and  and .
  \end{definition}
  
  Finally, recall that two languages  and  are {\em synchronously nonconflicting\/} if .
  \begin{theorem}[\cite{cdc-ecc2011}]\label{thm3}
    Let  be a generator over an alphabet , and let  be a high-level specification. Assume that  is observation consistent with respect to projections , , and , that  and  are synchronously nonconflicting, and that  is locally observation consistent with respect to , , and . Then, the language  is observable with respect to , , and  if and only if the language  is observable with respect to , , and .
  \end{theorem}


\section{Main Result}
  In this section, we prove that if the plant language  is a non-regular language, even though it is only a linear, deterministic context-free language, the observation consistency condition is undecidable. For the definitions of linear and deterministic context-free languages, the reader is referred to~\cite{salomaa}.
  
  \begin{theorem}
    The observation consistency condition for linear, deterministic context-free languages is undecidable.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    We prove the theorem by reduction of Post's Correspondence Problem (PCP) to the problem of observation consistency. Recall that PCP is the problem whether, given two finite sets  and  of  strings over an alphabet , there exists a sequence of indices , for , such that . It is well-known that PCP is undecidable~\cite{post}.
    
    Let  and  be an instance of PCP over an alphabet  such that for all , we have . Let  be a new alphabet, that is, . We use the notation  to denote the reversal or mirror image of a string . Define the language 
    
    Note that this language is linear and deterministic context-free, and it is also not hard to see that the language  is linear and deterministic context-free, too. The linearity is obvious from the form of the words, and a deterministic pushdown automaton works so that based on  it distinguishes the two parts of the language, and then it pushes the indices to the pushdown and after reading A:(\Sigma\cup\{@,\#,\ and the projection \}\cup E)^*\to (\Sigma\cup E)^*\overline{L}t,t'\in A(\overline{L})=\{@,@@,\#,\eps\}P_{hi}(t)=\eps=P_{hi}(t')i_1i_2\ldots i_kw_{i_1}w_{i_2}\ldots w_{i_k}=u_{i_1}u_{i_2}\ldots u_{i_k}t=t's=s'A(s)=A(s')=t=t'P(s)=P(s')t\neq t'tt't=@t'=@@s=@1\ and w_1^R@A(s)=@A(s')=@@P(s)=1w_1^R=P(s')t=@t'=\#s=@i_1i_2\ldots i_k\ and u_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^R\#A(s)=@A(s')=\#P(s)=i_1i_2\ldots i_kw_{i_k}^R\ldots w_{i_2}^Rw_{i_1}^R=i_1i_2\ldots i_ku_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^R=P(s')t=@t'=\epss=@i_1i_2\ldots i_k\ and u_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^RA(s)=@A(s')=\epsP(s)=i_1i_2\ldots i_kw_{i_k}^R\ldots w_{i_2}^Rw_{i_1}^R=i_1i_2\ldots i_ku_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^R=P(s')t=@@t'=\#s=@i_1i_2\ldots i_k\ and u_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^R\#A(s)=@@A(s')=\#P(s)=i_1i_2\ldots i_kw_{i_k}^R\ldots w_{i_2}^Rw_{i_1}^R=i_1i_2\ldots i_ku_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^R=P(s')t=@@t'=\epss=@i_1i_2\ldots i_k\ and u_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^RA(s)=@@A(s')=\epsP(s)=i_1i_2\ldots i_kw_{i_k}^R\ldots w_{i_2}^Rw_{i_1}^R=i_1i_2\ldots i_ku_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^R=P(s')t=\#t'=\epss=1\ and w_1^RA(s)=\#A(s')=\epsP(s)=1w_1^R=P(s')\overline{L}t=@@t'=\#ss'\overline{L}A(s)=@@A(s')=\#P(s)=P(s')\overline{L}ss'\overline{L}s@i_1i_2\ldots i_k\ and  be of a form u_{j_{k'}}^R\ldots u_{j_2}^Ru_{j_1}^R\#@@\#A(s)=@@A(s')=\#P(s)=i_1i_2\ldots i_kw_{i_k}^R\ldots w_{i_2}^Rw_{i_k}^R=j_1j_2\ldots j_{k'}u_{i_{k'}}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^R=P(s')i_1i_2\ldots i_k=j_1j_2\ldots j_{k'}k=k'i_z=j_z1\le z\le kw_{i_k}^R\ldots w_{i_2}^Rw_{i_1}^R=u_{i_k}^R\ldots u_{i_2}^Ru_{i_1}^Rw_{i_1}w_{i_2}\ldots w_{i_k}=u_{i_1}u_{i_2}\ldots u_{i_k}i_1 i_2 \ldots i_kss't=@@t'=\#\overline{L}$ satisfies the observation consistency condition, which means that observation consistency is undecidable for linear, deterministic context-free languages.
  \qed\end{proof}
  
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
  In this paper, we have shown that if the language is linear, deterministic context-free, then the observation consistency condition is undecidable. However, it needs to be mentioned that no algorithm is known to decide the observation consistency condition even for regular languages. More specifically, it is an open problem whether the condition of observation consistency is decidable for regular languages. This condition is of great interest in hierarchical control with partial observation, and so is the decidability problem. Moreover, if it is proven undecidable, a stronger condition that implies observation consistency, is decidable, and does not imply that all observable events must be included in the high-level alphabet is of great interest.
