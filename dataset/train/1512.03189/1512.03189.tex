\section{Introduction}\label{s-introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} investigation of multi-agent coordination has regularly attracted contributions from mathematicians, physicists and engineers over the two decades. Classic multi-agent coordination of interest includes consensus \cite{Olfati-Saber07}, flocking \cite{Saber06}, containment control \cite{cao11},  formation control \cite{xiao09}, coverage control \cite{cortes02}, and distributed estimation \cite{yang2008}. Much interest is focusing on dynamic models of agents. Examples include the study of distributed coordination of first-order, second-order, continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic agents. By using the matrix theory, the graph theory, the frequency-domain analysis method and the Lyapunov method etc., lots of results about multi-agent coordination have been obtained \cite{Renbook08,Xiao08-1,ji09,su14}.

As a fundamental problem of distributed coordination, consensus means that a group of agents reach an agreement on the consistent quantity of interest by designing appropriate control input based on local information. Vicsek et al. \cite{vicsek95} proposed a discrete-time model of  agents all moving in the plane with the same speed and demonstrated by simulation that all agents move to one direction. By virtue of graph theory, Jadbabaie et al. \cite{jabdabaie03} explained the consensus behaviour of Vicsek model theoretically and shown that consensus can be achieved if the union of interaction graphs are connected frequently enough. By utilizing the pre-leader-follower decomposition, Wang and Xiao \cite{xiao06-1} studied the state consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems with bounded time-delays. Second-order consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems was considered in \cite{lin09} with nonuniform time-delays. Gossip algorithms \cite{boyd06} and broadcast gossip algorithms \cite{aysal09} were also used to analyze the consensus problem, respectively. For continuous-time dynamic agents, Olfati-Saber and Murray \cite{sabertac04} considered the consensus problem of multi-agent systems with switching topologies and time-delays and obtained some necessary and/or sufficient conditions for solving the average consensus. Ren and Beard \cite{ren05} extended the results given in \cite{sabertac04} and presented some more relaxable conditions for solving the consensus. Xie and Wang \cite{Xie07} studied the second-order consensus of multi-agent systems with fixed and switching topologies. Ren \cite{Ren08} investigated the second-order consensus of multi-agent systems in four cases.

Hybrid systems are dynamical systems that involve the interaction of continuous and discrete dynamics. As a class of classic hybrid systems, switched systems have received a major research \cite{Antsaklis2000}. For multi-agent systems, lots of references were concerned with consensus problem under switching topologies \cite{sabertac04,Sun08}. However, Zheng and Wang \cite{Zheng2015} considered the consensus of switched multi-agent system that consists of continuous-time and discrete-time subsystems. They proved that the consensus of switched multi-agent system is solvable under arbitrary switching. Zhu et al. \cite{zhu2015} studied the containment control of such switched multi-agent system. In the practical systems, the dynamics of the agents coupled with each others are different, i.e., the dynamics of agents are hybrid. In general, hybrid means heterogeneous in nature or composition. Different from the previous study, Zheng et al. \cite{zheng11-2} considered the consensus of heterogeneous multi-agent system which is composed of first-order and second-order dynamic agents. The consensus criteria were obtained under different topologies \cite{zheng12-3,zheng12-1}. Finite-time consensus and containment control of the heterogeneous multi-agent system were also studied in \cite{zheng12-2,Zheng14}, respectively.

To the best of our knowledge, however, the existing results of consensus analysis are on the homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-agent systems, i.e., all the agents are continuous-time or discrete-time dynamic behavior at the same time. In the real world, natural and artificial individuals can show collective decision-making. For example, autonomous robots were used to control self-organized behavioral patterns in group-living cockroaches \cite{Halloy2007}. When the continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic agents coexist and interact with each other, it is important to study the consensus problem of such hybrid multi-agent system.  Owing to the coexistence of continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic agents, it is difficult to design the consensus protocol and analyze the consensus problem for hybrid multi-agent system. Up to now, it is not found any approach to analyze the consensus of multi-agent systems with different time-scale. The main objective of this paper is to design the consensus protocols and obtain the consensus criteria of hybrid multi-agent system in different topologies. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose the hybrid multi-agent system and give the definition of consensus. Second, three kinds of consensus protocols are presented for hybrid multi-agent system. Finally, by utilizing of the graph theory, some necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for solving the consensus of hybrid multi-agent system.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{s-preliminaries}, we present some notions in graph theory and propose the hybrid multi-agent system. In Section \ref{s-Main results}, three kinds of consensus protocols are provided for solving the consensus of hybrid multi-agent system. In Section \ref{s-Simulations}, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section \ref{s-Conclusion}.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{s-preliminaries}

\subsection{Graph theory}\label{s-graph theory}

A weighted directed graph  of order 
consists of a vertex set ,  an edge set
 and a nonnegative
matrix . The neighbor set of the agent  is
. A directed path between two distinct vertices  and  is
a finite ordered sequence of distinct edges of  with the form .
A directed tree is a directed graph, where there exists a vertex called the root such that there exists a unique directed path from this vertex to every other vertex. A directed spanning tree is a directed tree, which consists of all the nodes and some edges in .
If a directed graph has the property that , the directed graph is called undirected. An undirected graph is said to be connected if there exists a path between any two distinct vertices of the graph. The degree matrix
 is a diagonal matrix with  and
the Laplacian matrix of the graph is defined as 
It is easy to see that . 
A nonnegative matrix is said to be a (row) stochastic matrix if all its row sums are . A stochastic matrix  is called indecomposable and aperiodic (SIA) if  , where  is some column vector.  is said the graph associated with  when  if and only if . The following results propose the relationship between a stochastic matrix and its associated graph.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma-renw-3.5}(\cite{ren05})  A stochastic matrix has algebraic multiplicity equal
to one for its eigenvalue  if and only if the graph associated
with the matrix has a spanning tree. Furthermore, a stochastic matrix
with positive diagonal elements has the property that  for every
eigenvalue not equal to one.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma-renw-3.7}(\cite{ren05}) Let  be a stochastic matrix. If
A has an eigenvalue  with algebraic multiplicity equal to one,
and all the other eigenvalues satisfy , then  is SIA, that is,
, where  satisfies  and . Furthermore, each element of  is nonnegative.
\end{lemma}

Based on Lemma \ref{lemma-renw-3.5} and Lemma \ref{lemma-renw-3.7}, we give the following result which will be used in the next content.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma-1}
Let  and , . Then,  is SIA, i.e., , if and only if graph  has a spanning tree. Furthermore, ,  and each element of  is nonnegative.
\end{lemma}
{\it Proof.} \textbf{(Sufficiency)} Let . From the definition of , we have  where . It follows from  that  is a positive diagonal matrix. Consequently, it is easy to obtain that  is a stochastic matrix with positive diagonal entries. Obviously, for all , the -th entry of  is positive if and only if . Then,  is the graph associated with . Combining Lemma \ref{lemma-renw-3.5} and Lemma \ref{lemma-renw-3.7}, we have when graph  has a spanning tree,  where  is a nonnegative vector. Moreover,  satisfies  and .

\textbf{(Necessary)} From Lemma \ref{lemma-renw-3.5}, if  does not have a spanning tree, the algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalue  of  is . Then, it is easy to prove that the rank of  is greater than 1, which implies that . 


\subsection{Hybrid multi-agent system}\label{s-Hybrid multi-agent systems}

Suppose that the hybrid multi-agent system consists of continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic agents. The number of agents is , labelled  through , where the number of continuous-time dynamic agents is  . Without loss of generality, we assume that agent  through agent  are continuous-time dynamic agents. Then, each agent has the dynamics as follows:

where  is the sampling period,  and  are the position-like and control input of agent , respectively. The initial conditions are .  Let .

Each agent is regraded as a vertex in a graph. Each edge  corresponds to an available information link from agent  to agent . Moreover, each agent updates its current state based on the information received from its neighbors. In this paper, we suppose that there exists communication behavior in hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}), i.e.,  there are agent  and agent  which make .

\begin{definition}\label{def-consensus} Hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) is said to reach consensus if for any initial conditions, we have

and

\end{definition}



\section{Main results}\label{s-Main results}

In this section, the consensus problem of hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) will be considered under three kinds of control inputs (consensus protocols) respectively.





\subsection{Case 1}\label{s-case1}
In this subsection, we assume that all agents communicate with their neighbours and update their control inputs in the sampling time . Then, the consensus protocol for hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) is presented as follows.

where  is the weighted adjacency matrix
associated with the graph ,  is the sampling period.

\begin{theorem}\label{consensus-case1}
Consider a directed communication network  and suppose that . Then, hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) with protocol (\ref{control-input-1}) can solve consensus if and only if the network  has a directed spanning tree. Moreover, the consensus state is , where .  \end{theorem}

{\it Proof.} \textbf{(Sufficiency)} Firstly, we will prove that equation (\ref{lim-tk-1}) holds. From (\ref{control-input-1}), we know that

Therefore, it follows that


Let . Then, equation (\ref{state-tk-1}) can be written in matrix form as

According to Lemma \ref{lemma-1}, since  has a directed spanning tree and , we have
,
where . Thus, it is easy to obtain

and .
As a consequence, equation (\ref{lim-tk-1}) holds. Moreover,


Secondly, we have

From (\ref{state-t-1}),  it is easy to know that

when , we have . Thus,

Moreover,

which implies that equation (\ref{lim-t-1}) holds.

Therefore, hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) with protocol (\ref{control-input-1}) can solve consensus probem with consensus state , where .

\textbf{(Necessity)} From Lemma \ref{lemma-1}, we have  when  does not have a directed spanning tree. Therefore, equation (\ref{lim-tk-1}) does not hold, which implies that hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) can not reach consensus. 



\subsection{Case 2}\label{s-case2}

In this subsection, we still assume that the interaction among agents happens in sampling time . However, different from Case 1, we assume that each continuous-time dynamic agent can observe its own state in real time. Thus, the consensus protocol for hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) is presented as follows. 
where  is the weighted adjacency matrix
associated with the graph ,  is the sampling period.


\begin{theorem}\label{consensus-case2}
Consider a directed communication network  and suppose that . Then, hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) with protocol (\ref{control-input-2}) can solve consensus if and only if the network  has a directed spanning tree. Moreover, the consensus state is , where ,  .
\end{theorem}

{\it Proof.} \textbf{(Sufficiency)} Firstly, we will prove that equation (\ref{lim-tk-1}) holds. Solving hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) with protocol (\ref{control-input-2}), we have

Accordingly, at time , the states of agents are

Hence, (\ref{state-tk-2}) can be rewritten in compact form as

where , .


It is easy to know that , . Owing to , we have  for .  From Lemma \ref{lemma-1}, because  has a directed spanning tree,  is an SIA matrix, i.e.,
,
where . Hence,

which means that

Obviously, equation (\ref{lim-tk-1}) holds. Moreover, it follows from  that .

Secondly, we know from (\ref{state-t-2}) that

Since  when ,

Thus, we have

Consequently, equation (\ref{lim-t-1}) holds.

Therefore, from Definition \ref{def-consensus}, hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) with protocol (\ref{control-input-2}) reaches consensus. Moreover, the consensus state is .


\textbf{(Necessity)} Similar to the proof of necessity in Theorem \ref{consensus-case1}, we know that if the directed communication network  does not have a directed spanning tree, then hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) can not achieve consensus. 

\begin{remark}\label{h}
Compared with the restriction of sampling period  in Theorem \ref{consensus-case1} and Theorem \ref{consensus-case2}, it is easy to find that  is only related to the out-degrees of discrete-time dynamic agents if each continuous-time dynamic agent can observe the real time information.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Case 3}\label{s-case3}

In this subsection, we assume that all agents interact with each other in a gossip-like manner. Some assumptions are given as follows.

(\textbf{A1}) The communication network of hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) is undirected, i.e.,  for all .

(\textbf{A2}) At time , two agents  and  () satisfying  are chosen with probability , where  and .

When agents  and  are chosen, their interplay follows the below situations, where  is the sampling period.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If  and  are continuous-time dynamic agents, i.e., , they will communicate during . The control inputs of two agents are
      
  \item If  is continuous-time dynamic agent and  is discrete-time dynamic agent, i.e., , the control inputs of two agents are
      
  \item If  and  are discrete-time dynamic agents, i.e., , the control inputs of two agents are
      
\end{itemize}
For each , it keeps static, i.e.,



\begin{theorem}\label{consensus-gossip}
Consider an undirected communication network . Assume that (A1)--(A2) hold and . Then, hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) with control input (\ref{gossip-CC})--(\ref{gossip-lf}) can solve consensus in mean sense if and only if the network  is connected.
\end{theorem}
{\it Proof.} \textbf{(Sufficiency)} It suffices to prove that

and

hold for any initial states.
Firstly, we will show that equation (\ref{E-lim-tk-1}) holds. From (\ref{gossip-CC})--(\ref{gossip-lf}), if agents  and  are selected to interplay at time , the states of all agents at time  are three cases:

&(I)~~&&
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&x_i(t_{k+1})=x_i(t_{k})+\frac{1-e^{-2a_{ij}h}}{2}(x_j(t_{k})-x_i(t_{k})),~&&i\in \mathcal{I}_m,\\
&x_j(t_{k+1})=x_j(t_{k})+\frac{1-e^{-2a_{ij}h}}{2}(x_i(t_{k})-x_j(t_{k})),~&&j\in \mathcal{I}_m,\\
&x_r(t_{k+1})=x_r(t_{k}),~~&&r\in\mathcal{I}_n/\{i,j\},
\end{aligned}
\right. \label{GS-CC} \\
&(II)~~&&
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&x_i(t_{k+1})=x_i(t_k)+(1-e^{-a_{ij}h})(x_j(t_k)-x_i(t_k)),~&&i\in \mathcal{I}_m,\\
&x_j(t_{k+1})=x_j(t_{k})+ha_{ji}(x_i(t_k)-x_j(t_k)),&&j\in \mathcal{I}_{n}/\mathcal{I}_{m},\\
&x_r(t_{k+1})=x_r(t_{k}),~~&&r\in\mathcal{I}_n/\{i,j\},
\end{aligned}
\right.\label{GS-CD}\\
&(III)~~&&
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&x_i(t_{k+1})=x_i(t_k)+ha_{ij}(x_j(t)-x_i(t_k)),~&&j\in \mathcal{I}_{n}/\mathcal{I}_{m},\\
&x_j(t_{k+1})=x_j(t_k)+ha_{ji}(x_i(t_k)-x_j(t_k)),~&&j\in \mathcal{I}_{n}/\mathcal{I}_{m},\\
&x_r(t_{k+1})=x_r(t_{k}),~~&&r\in\mathcal{I}_n/\{i,j\}.
\end{aligned}
\right.\label{GS-DD}

Note that (\ref{gossip-states}) can be rewritten in the following compact form as

where

According to (A2), it is not hard to know that  is a stochastic
linear system
Therefore, it follows that


Due to , we have ,  and . Thus,  is a stochastic matrix with positive diagonal entries. Moreover, the -th and -th entries of  are positive, while all other non-diagonal entries are zeros. Hence, noticing that

we know that  is a stochastic matrix satisfying
\begin{itemize}
  \item all diagonal entries are positive;
  \item the -th and -th entries are positive if and only if .
\end{itemize}

Consequently,  is the graph associated with . Since  is connected, combining Lemma \ref{lemma-renw-3.5} and Lemma \ref{lemma-renw-3.7}, we have

From (\ref{gossip-Estate-tk}), we have

which implies that equation (\ref{E-lim-tk-1}) holds.

Secondly, at time , the state of each  follows the below three scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
  \item if~~is~selected~to~communicate~with~its~ continuous-time dynamical~neighbour~, 
  \item if~~is~selected~to~communicate~with~its~ discrete-time dynamical~neighbour~,
  
  \item if~ is not selected, 
\end{itemize}
Thus, we have

where

Since  when , it is easy to obtain from (\ref{gossip-Estate-t}) that

holds for all , which means equation (\ref{E-lim-t-1}) holds.

Therefore, hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) with control inputs (\ref{gossip-CC})--(\ref{gossip-lf}) can solve consensus problem in mean sense.

\textbf{(Necessity)} When  is not connected, similar to the proof of necessity in Theorem \ref{consensus-case1}, we know that hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) can not reach consensus. 




\begin{remark}\label{unified}
Note that hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) presents a unified framework for both the discrete-time multi-agent system and the continuous-time multi-agent system. In other words, if , hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) becomes a discrete-time multi-agent system. And if , hybrid multi-agent system (\ref{mod-hybrid}) becomes a continuous-time multi-agent system.
\end{remark}
\section{Simulations }\label{s-Simulations}

In this section, we provided some simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results in this paper.
