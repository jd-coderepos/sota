\begin{abstract}
Distributed frameworks are gaining increasingly widespread use in applications that process large amounts of data. One important example application is large scale similarity search, for which Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has emerged as the method of choice, specially when the data is high-dimensional. At its core, LSH is based on hashing the data points to a number of buckets such that similar points are more likely to map to the same buckets. To guarantee high search quality, the LSH scheme needs a rather large number of hash tables. This entails a large space requirement, and in the distributed setting, with each query requiring a network call per hash bucket look up, this also entails a big network load. The Entropy LSH scheme proposed by Panigrahy significantly reduces the number of required hash tables by looking up a number of query offsets in addition to the query itself. While this improves the LSH space requirement, it does not help with (and in fact worsens) the search network efficiency, as now each query offset requires a network call. In this paper, focusing on the Euclidian space under  norm and building up on Entropy LSH, we propose the distributed Layered LSH scheme, and prove that it exponentially decreases the network cost, while maintaining a good load balance between different machines. Our experiments also verify that our scheme results in a significant network traffic reduction that brings about large runtime improvement in real world applications.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Similarity search is the problem of retrieving data objects similar to a query object. It has become an important component of modern data-mining systems, with applications ranging from de-duplication of web documents, content-based audio, video, and image search \cite{Brian:Kulis, Charikar:multiprobe, google:video:lsh}, collaborative filtering \cite{google-news}, large scale genomic sequence alignment \cite{Buhler}, natural language processing \cite{ravi:NLP:clustering}, pattern classification \cite{cover67}, and clustering \cite{berkhin}.  


In these applications, objects are usually represented by a high dimensional feature vector. A scheme to solve the similarity search problem constructs an index which, given a query point, allows for quickly finding the data points similar to it. In addition to the query search procedure, the index construction also needs to be time and space efficient. Furthermore, since today's massive datasets are typically stored and processed in a distributed fashion, where network communication is one of the most important bottlenecks, these methods need to be network efficient, as otherwise, the network load would slow down the whole scheme.

An important family of similarity search methods is based on the notion of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) \cite{im98}. At its core, LSH is based on hashing the (data and query) points into a number of hash buckets such that similar points have higher chances of getting mapped to the same buckets. Then for each query, the nearest neighbor among the data points mapped to a same bucket as the query point is returned as the search result.

LSH has been shown to scale well with the data dimension \cite{im98,KOR98}. However, the main drawback of conventional LSH based schemes is that to guarantee a good search quality, one needs a large number of hash tables. This entails a rather large space requirement for the index, and also in the distributed setting, a large network load, as each hash bucket look up requires a communication over the network. To mitigate the space efficiency issue, Panigrahy \cite{P06} proposed the Entropy LSH scheme, which significantly reduces the number of required hash tables, by looking up a number of query offsets in addition to the query itself. Even though this scheme improves the LSH space efficiency, it does not help with its network efficiency, as now each query offset lookup requires a network call. In fact, since the number of required offsets in Entropy LSH is larger than the number of required hash tables in conventional LSH, Entropy LSH amplifies the network inefficiency issue.

In this paper, focusing on the Euclidian space under  norm and building up on the Entropy LSH scheme, we design the Layered LSH method for distributing the hash buckets over a set of machines which leads to a very high network efficiency. We prove that, compared to a straightforward distributed implementation of LSH or Entropy LSH, our Layered LSH method results in an exponential improvement in the network load (from polynomial in , the number of data points, to sub-logarithmic in ), while maintaining a good load balance between the different machines. Our experiments also verify that our scheme results in large network traffic improvement that in turn results in significant runtime speedups. 

In the rest of this section, we first provide some background on the similarity search problem and the relevant methods, then discuss LSH in the distributed computation model, and finally present an overview of our scheme as well as our results.


\subsection{Background}
\label{sec:bckgrnd}

In this section, we briefly review the similarity search problem, the basic LSH and Entropy LSH approaches to solving it, the distributed computation framework and its instantiations such as MapReduce and Active DHT, and a straightforward implementation of LSH in the distributed setting as well as its major drawback.

\noindent \textbf{Similarity Search:} The similarity search problem is that of finding data objects similar to a query object. In many practical applications, the objects are represented by multidimensional feature vectors, and hence the problem reduces to finding objects close to the query object under the feature space distance metric. The goal in all these problems is to construct an index, which given the query point, allows for quickly finding the search results. The index construction and the query search both need to be space, time, and network efficient.


\noindent \textbf{Basic LSH:} A method to solve the similarity search problem over high dimensional large datasets is based on a specific type of hash functions, namely Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) functions, proposed by Indyk and Motwani \cite{im98}. An LSH function maps the points in the feature space to a number of buckets in a way that similar points map to the same buckets with a high chance. Then, a similarity search query can be answered by first hashing the query point and then finding the close data points in the same bucket as the one the query is mapped to. To guarantee both a good search quality and a good search efficiency, one needs to use multiple LSH functions and combine their results. Then, although this approach yields a significant improvement in the running time over both the brute force linear scan and the space partitioning approaches \cite{gim99, Bentley:kdtree, Kakade:covertrees, Krauthgamer:lee:navigating:nets, Rtrees, SRtrees}, unfortunately the required number of hash functions is usually large \cite{Buhler, gim99}, and since each hash table has the same size as the dataset, for large scale applications, this entails a very large space requirement for the index. Also, in the distributed setting, since each hash table lookup at query time corresponds to a network call, this entails a large network load which is also undesirable.

\noindent \textbf{Entropy LSH:} To mitigate the space inefficiency of LSH, Panigrahy \cite{P06} introduced the Entropy LSH scheme. This scheme uses the same hash functions and indexing method as the basic LSH scheme. However, it uses a different query time procedure: In addition to hashing the query point, it hashes a number of query offsets as well and also looks up the hash buckets that any of these offsets map to. The idea is that the close data points are very likely to be mapped to either the same bucket as the query point or to the same bucket as one of the query offsets. This significantly reduces the number of hash tables required to guarantee the search quality and efficiency. Hence, this scheme significantly improves the index space requirement compared to the basic LSH method. However, it unfortunately does not help with the query network efficiency, as each query offset requires a network call. Indeed, since one can see that \cite{im98, P06, Charikar:multiprobe} the number of query offsets required by Entropy LSH is larger than the number of hash tables required by basic LSH, the query network efficiency of Entropy LSH is even worse than that of the basic LSH.

In this paper, we focus on the network efficiency of LSH in distributed frameworks. Two main instantiations of such frameworks are the batched processing system MapReduce \cite{mapreduce} (with its open source implementation Apache Hadoop \cite{Hadoop}), and the real-time processing system denoted as Active Distributed Hash Table (Active DHT), such as Twitter Storm \cite{Storm}. The common feature in all these systems is that they process data in the form of (Key, Value) pairs, distributed over a set of machines. This distributed (Key, Value) abstraction is all we need for both our scheme and analyses to apply. However, to make the later discussions more concrete, here we briefly overview the mentioned distributed systems.

\noindent \textbf{MapReduce:} MapReduce \cite{mapreduce} is a simple model for batched distributed processing using a number of commodity machines, where computations are done in three phases. The Map phase reads a collection of (Key, Value) pairs from an input source, and by invoking a user defined Mapper function on each input element independently and in parallel, emits zero or more (Key, Value) pairs associated with that input element. The Shuffle phase then groups together all the Mapper-emitted (Key, Value) pairs sharing the same Key, and outputs each distinct group to the next phase. The Reduce phase invokes a user-defined Reducer function on each distinct group, independently and in parallel, and emits zero or more values to associate with the group's Key. The emitted (Key, Value) pairs can then be written on the disk or be the input of the Map phase in a following iteration. 


\noindent \textbf{Active DHT:} A DHT (Distributed Hash Table) is a distributed (Key, Value) store which allows Lookups, Inserts, and Deletes on the basis of the Key. The term {\em Active} refers to the fact that an arbitrary User Defined Function (UDF) can be executed on a (Key, Value) pair in addition to Insert, Delete, and Lookup. Twitter's Storm~\cite{Storm} is an example of Active DHT that is gaining widespread use. The Active DHT model is broad enough to act as a distributed stream processing system and as a continuous version of MapReduce \cite{OnePassMR}. All the (Key, Value) pairs in a node of the active DHT are usually stored in main memory to allow for fast real-time processing of data and queries. 

In addition to the typical performance measures of total running time and total space, two other measures are very important for both MapReduce and Active DHTs. First, the total network traffic generated, that is the shuffle size for MapReduce and the number of network calls for Active DHT, and second, the maximum number of values with the same key; a high value here can lead to the ``curse of the last reducer'' in MapReduce \cite{curselast} or to one compute node becoming a bottleneck in Active DHT. 



Next, we will briefly discuss a simple implementation of LSH in distributed frameworks. 

\noindent \textbf{A Simple Distributed LSH Implementation:} \\ 
Each hash table associates a (Key, Value) pair to each data point, where the Key is the point's hash bucket, and the Value is the point itself. These (Key, Value) pairs are randomly distributed over the set of machines such that all the pairs with the same Key are on the same machine. This is done implicitly using a random hash function of the Key. For each query, first a number of (Key, Value) pairs corresponding to the query point are generated. The Value in all of these pairs is the query point itself. For basic LSH, per hash table, the Key is the hash bucket the query maps to, and for Entropy LSH, per query offset, the Key is the hash bucket the offset maps to. Then, each of these (Key, Value) pairs gets sent to and processed by the machine responsible for its Key. This machine contains all data points mapping to the same query or offset hash bucket. Then, it can perform a search within the data points which also map to the same Key and report the close points. This search can be done using the UDF in Active DHT or the Reducer in MapReduce.

In the above implementation, the amount of network communication per query is directly proportional to the number of hash buckets that need to be checked. However, as mentioned earlier, this number is large for both basic LSH and Entropy LSH. Hence, in large scale applications, where either there is a huge batch of queries or the queries arrive in real-time at very high rates, this will require a lot of communication, which not only depletes the valuable network resources in a shared environment, but also significantly slows down the query search process. In this paper, we propose an alternative way, called Layered LSH, to implement the Entropy LSH scheme in a distributed framework and prove that it exponentially reduces the network load compared to the above implementation, while maintaining a good load balance between different machines.

\subsection{Overview of Our Scheme}
\label{sec:overview}

At its core, Layered LSH is a carefully designed implementation of Entropy LSH in the distributed (Key, Value) model. The main idea is to distribute the hash buckets such that near points are likely to be on the same machine (hence network efficiency) while far points are likely to be on different machines (hence load balance). 

This is achieved by rehashing the buckets to which the data points and the offsets of query points map to, via an additional layer of LSH, and then using the hashed buckets as Keys. More specifically, each data point is associated with a (Key, Value) pair where Key is the mapped value of LSH bucket containing the point, and Value is the point's hash bucket concatenated with the point itself. Also, each query point is associated with multiple (Key, Value) pairs where Value is the query itself and Keys are the mapped values of the buckets which need to be searched in order to answer this query. 

Use of an LSH to rehash the buckets not only allows using the proximity of query offsets to bound the number of (Key, Value) pairs for each query (thus guaranteeing network efficiency), but also ensures that far points are unlikely to be hashed to the same machine (thus maintaining load balance).

\subsection{Our Results}
\label{sec:results}

Here, we present a summary of our results in this paper:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We prove that Layered LSH incurs only  network cost per query. This is an exponential improvement over the  query network cost of the simple distributed implementation of both Entropy LSH and basic LSH.  
\item Surprisingly, we prove that, the network efficiency of Layered LSH is independent of the search quality. This is in sharp contrast with both Entropy LSH and basic LSH in which increasing search quality directly increases the network cost. This offers a very large improvement in both network efficiency and hence overall run time in settings which require similarity search with high accuracy. We also present experiments which verify this observation on the MapReduce framework.
\item We prove that despite network efficiency (which requires collocating near points on the same machines), Layered LSH sends points which are only  apart to different machines with high likelihood. This shows Layered LSH hits the right tradeoff between network efficiency and load balance across machines.
\item We present experimental results with Layered LSH on Hadoop, which show it also works very well in practice.

\end{enumerate}


The organization of this paper is as follows. 
In section \ref{sec:prelim}, we study the Basic and Entropy LSH indexing methods. In section \ref{sec:distlsh}, we give the detailed description of Layered LSH, including its pseudocode for the MapReduce and Active DHT frameworks, and also provide the theoretical analysis of its network cost and load balance. We present the results of our experiments on Hadoop in section \ref{sec:exp}, study the related work in section \ref{sec:rel}, and conclude in section \ref{sec:conc}. 

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}

In section \ref{sec:bckgrnd}, we provided the high-level background needed for this paper. Here, we present the necessary preliminaries in further detail. Specifically, we formally define the similarity search problem, the notion of LSH functions, the basic LSH indexing, and Entropy LSH indexing.

\noindent \textbf{Similarity Search:} As mentioned in section \ref{sec:bckgrnd}, similarity search in a metric space with domain  reduces to the problem more commonly known as the -NN problem, where given an approximation ratio , the goal is to construct an index that given any query point  within distance  of a data point, allows for quickly finding a data point  whose distance to  is at most .



\noindent \textbf{Basic LSH:} To solve the -NN problem, Indyk and Motwani \cite{im98} introduced the following notion of LSH functions:

\newcommand{\norm}[1]{{\left\Vert#1\right\Vert}_2}
\newcommand{\probH}[1]{{\bf\mbox{\bf Pr}}_{\mathcal{H}}\left[#1\right]}
\newcommand{\etal}{{\em et al. }}
\begin{defn}
\label{def:LSH}
For the space  with metric ,  given distance threshold , approximation ratio , and probabilities , a family of hash functions  is said to be a -LSH family if for all , 

\end{defn}

Hash functions drawn from  have the property that near points (with distance at most ) have a high likelihood (at least ) of being hashed to the same value, while far away points (with distance at least ) are less likely (probability at most ) to be hashed to the same value; hence the name locality sensitive. 

LSH families can be used to design an index for the -NN problem as follows. First, for an integer , let  be a family of hash functions in which any  is the concatenation of  functions in , i.e., , where  (). Then, for an integer , draw  hash functions from , independently and uniformly at random, and use them to construct the index consisting of  hash tables on the data points. With this index, given a query , the similarity search is done by first generating the set of all data points mapping to the same bucket as  in at least one hash table, and then finding the closest point to  among those data points. The idea is that a function drawn from  has a very small chance () to map far away points to the same bucket (hence search efficiency), but since it also makes it less likely () for a near point to map to the same bucket, we use a number, , of hash tables to guarantee retrieving the near points with a good chance (hence search quality).






To utilize this indexing scheme, one needs an LSH family  to start with. Such families are known for a variety of metric spaces, including the Hamming distance, the Earth Mover Distance, and the Jaccard measure \cite{C02}. Furthermore, Datar et al. \cite{DIIM04} proposed LSH families for  norms, with , using -stable distributions. For any , they consider a family of hash functions  such that 
 
where  is a -dimensional vector each of whose entries are chosen independently from a -stable distribution, and  is chosen uniformly from . Further improvements have been obtained in various special settings \cite{AI06}. In this paper, we will focus on the most widely used -stable distribution, i.e., the -stable, Gaussian distribution. For this case, Indyk and Motwani \cite{im98} proved the following theorem: 

\begin{thm} With  data points, choosing  and , the LSH indexing scheme above solves the -NN problem with constant probability.
\end{thm}

Although Basic LSH yields a significant improvement in the running time over both the brute force linear scan and the space partitioning approaches \cite{expt:space:partitioning, Kakade:covertrees, Krauthgamer:lee:navigating:nets}, unfortunately the required number of hash functions is usually large \cite{Buhler, gim99}, which entails a very large space requirement for the index. Also, in the distributed setting, each hash table lookup at query time corresponds to a network call which entails a large network load.

\noindent \textbf{Entropy LSH: } To mitigate the space inefficiency, Panigrahy \cite{P06} introduced the Entropy LSH scheme. This scheme uses the same indexing as in the basic LSH scheme, but a different query search procedure. The idea here is that for each hash function , the data points close to the query point  are highly likely to hash either to the same value as  or to a value very close to that. Hence, it makes sense to also consider as candidates the points mapping to close hash values. To do so, in this scheme, in addition to , several ``offsets"  (), chosen randomly from the surface of , the sphere of radius  centered at , are also hashed and the data points in their hash buckets are also considered as search result candidates. It is conceivable that this may reduce the number of required hash tables, and in fact, Panigrahy \cite{P06} shows that with this scheme one can use as few as  hash tables. The instantiation of his result for the  norm is as follows:

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:ELSH}
For  data points, choosing  (with  as in Definition \ref{def:LSH}) and , as few as  hash tables suffice to solve the -NN problem.
\end{thm}

Hence, this scheme in fact significantly reduces the number of required hash tables (from  for basic LSH to ), and hence the space efficiency of LSH. However, in the distributed setting, it does not help with reducing the network load of LSH queries. Actually, since for the basic LSH, one needs to look up  buckets but with this scheme, one needs to look up  offsets, it makes the network inefficiency issue even more severe.


\comment{
Consider a set of points  in the -dimensional Euclidean space . First we define the -Approximate Nearest Neighbor Problem
\begin{defn}{ -Approximate Nearest Neighbor Problem or the -ANN Problem: } \\
Given a data set  consisting of  points in , construct a data structure which, given a query , outputs a data point whose distance to  is at most  times the distance from  to its nearest neighbor. 
\end{defn} 

In this paper, we refer to a point  such that  as being a -neighbor of  for any .
The -ANNS problem can be solved by reducing it to its decision version, the -Near Neighbor problem. This is defined as,


\begin{defn}{ -Near Neighbor Problem or the -NN Problem: } \\
 Given a data set  consisting of  points in a metric space, construct a data structure that for any query , if  which is a -neighbor of , output a point  which is a -neighbor of . 
\end{defn} 
It has been shown that this reduction to the -NN problem adds only a logarithmic factor in running time and size of the data structure \cite{HP01, im98}. 

In order to solve the -NN problem, Indyk and Motwani introduced locality sensitive hash (LSH) functions.

\begin{defn}
A family of hash functions  is said to be -sensitive if , 

\end{defn}

Functions drawn  have the property that near points (distance at most ) have a high likelihood of being hashed to the same value (at least ) and far away points (distance at least ) are less unlikely to be hashed to the same value (probability at most ) \cite{im98,KOR98}. 

Datar \etal show LSH function family based on the use of -stable normal distribution  (the notation  denotes a normal distribution with mean  and variance ). For any , they consider a family of hash functions  such that  which consists of hash functions  indexed by a random choice of  and ,with  and individual components  of ,  chosen from  and  chosen uniformly from . It can be shown that  is  sensitive with  \cite{DIIM04}. Apart from the Euclidean space, LSH function families are known to exist for other metric spaces like the Earth Mover Distance, Hamming metric and more generally, -normed space for , \cite{C02, DIIM04}.


The -NN problem, can be solved using a LSH family  by the following indexing mechanism. For a positive integers  to be defined later, we define a family of hash functions  and for ,  where  for .  Next, 
we choose  hash functions  from , where  is also a integer which will be defined later, and construct  hash tables using the functions  by adding  to bucket  in  hash table,  in the preprocessing step. The query processing step consists of search the buckets to which the query  is  mapped to in each of the  hash tables for any -neighbors to . Indyk and Motwani showed that choosing  and  solves the -NN problem with constant probability. 


Although this approach yields a significant improvement in the running time over space partitioning approaches \cite{gim99}, the improvement comes at the cost of increased index size since  replicas of each point need to be stored. For applications on large or web-scale data sets, this can be impractical \cite{Charikar:multiprobe, P06}. In order to reduce the space requirement, Panigrahy proposed a novel method ``Entropy LSH" which considers several randomly chosen ``offsets" in the neighborhood of the query point , and searches for -neighbors of  in the buckets to which these randomly chosen offsets are mapped to \cite{P06}. It can be shown that if  offsets are chosen in the neighborhood of , a single hash table suffices to solve the -NN problem \cite{P06}.

\section{Distributed LSH}
\label{sec:distlsh}

In this section, we will present the Layered LSH scheme and theoretically analyze it. We will focus on the -dimensional Euclidian space under  norm. As notation, we will let  to be a set of  data points available a-priori, and  to be the set of query points, either given as a batch (in case of MapReduce) or arriving in real-time (in case of Active DHT). Parameters  and LSH families  and  will be as defined in section \ref{sec:prelim}. Since multiple hash tables can be obviously implemented in parallel, for the sake of clarity we will focus on a single hash table and use a randomly chosen hash function  as our LSH function throughout the section. 



In (Key, Value) based distributed systems, a hash function from the domain of all Keys to the domain of available machines is implicitly used to determine the machine responsible for each (Key, Value) pair. In this section, for the sake of clarity, we will assume this mapping to be simply identity. That is, the machine responsible for a (Key, Value) data element is simply the machine with id equal to Key.

At the core, Layered LSH is a carefully distributed implementation of Entropy LSH. Hence before presenting it, first we further detail the simple distributed implementation of Entropy LSH, described in section \ref{sec:bckgrnd}, and explain its major drawback. For any data point  a (Key, Value) pair  is generated and sent to machine . For each query point , after generating the offsets  (), for each unique value  in the set  a (Key, Value) pair  is generated and sent to machine . Hence, machine  will have all the data points  with  as well as all query points  such that  for some . Then, for any received query point , this machine retrieves all data points  with  which are within distance  of q, if any such data points exist. This is done via a UDF in Active DHT or the Reducer in MapReduce, as presented in Figure \ref{distribution:H} for the sake of concreteness of exposition.  

In this implementation, the network load due to data points is not very significant. Not only just one (Key, Value) pair per data point is transmitted over the network, but also in many real-time applications, data indexing is done offline when efficiency and speed are not as critical. However, the amount of data transmitted per query in this implementation is :  (Key, Value) pairs, one per offset, each with the -dimensional point  as Value. Both  and  are large in many practical applications with high-dimensional data (e.g.,  can be in the hundreds, and  in the tens or hundreds). Hence, this implementation needs a lot of network communication per query, and with a large batch of queries or with queries arriving in real-time at very high rates, this will not only put a lot of strain on the valuable and usually shared network resources but also significantly slow down the search process.

Therefore, a distributed LSH scheme with significantly better query network efficiency is needed. This is where Layered LSH comes into the picture.

\subsection{Layered LSH}


In this subsection, we present the Layered LSH scheme. The main idea is to use another layer of locality sensitive hashing to distribute the data and query points over the machines. More specifically, given a parameter value , we sample an LSH function  such that:



where  is a -dimensional vector whose individual entries are chosen from the standard Gaussian  distribution, and  is chosen uniformly from .

Then, denoting  by , for each data point , we generate a (Key, Value) pair , which gets sent to machine . By breaking down the Value part to its two pieces,  and , this machine will then add  to the bucket . This can be done by the Reducer in MapReduce, and by a UDF in Active DHT. Similarly, for each query point , after generating the offsets  (), for each unique value  in the set

we generate a (Key, Value) pair  which gets sent to machine . Then, machine  will have all the data points  such that  as well as the queries  one of whose offsets gets mapped to  by . Specifically, if for the offset , we have , all the data points  that  are also located on machine . Then, this machine regenerates the offsets  (), finds their hash buckets , and for any of these buckets such that , it performs a similarity search among the data points in that bucket. Note that since  is sent to this machine, there exists at least one such bucket. Also note that, the offset regeneration, hash, and bucket search can all be done by either a UDF in Active DHT or the Reducer in MapReduce. To make the exposition more concrete, we have presented the pseudo code for both the MapReduce and Active DHT implementations of this scheme in Figure \ref{distribution:G}. 

At an intuitive level, the main idea in Layered LSH is that since  is an LSH, and also for any query point , we have  for all offsets  (), the set in equation \ref{eq:Gset} has a very small cardinality, which in turn implies a small amount of network communication per query. On the other hand, since  and  are both LSH functions, if two data points  are far apart,  and  are highly likely to be different. This means that, while locating the nearby points on the same machines, Layered LSH partitions the faraway data points on different machines, which in turn ensures a good load balance across the machines. Note that this is critical, as without a good load balance, the point in distributing the implementation would be lost.

In the next section, we present the formal analysis of this scheme, and prove that compared to the simple implementation, it provides an exponential improvement in the network traffic, while maintaining a good load balance across the machines.

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, we analyze the Layered LSH scheme presented in the previous section. We first fix some notation. As mentioned earlier in the paper, we are interested in the -NN problem. Without loss of generality and to simplify the notation, in this section we assume . This can be achieved by a simple scaling.
The LSH function  that we use is , where  is chosen as in Theorem \ref{thm:ELSH} and for each :
 
where  is a -dimensional vector each of whose entries is chosen from the standard Gaussian  distribution, and  is chosen uniformly from . We will also let  be , where for :

hence, . We will use the following small lemma in our analysis:
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:trieq} For any two vectors , we have:

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Denoting  () and , we have  (), and hence . Also, by definition , and hance . Then, the result follows from triangle inequality.
\end{proof}
Our analysis also uses two well-known facts. The first is the sharp concentration of -distributed random variables, which is also used in the proof of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma \cite{im98, Dasgupta_JL}, and the second is the -stability property of Gaussian distribution:

\begin{fact} \label{fact:sharpcon} If  is a random -dimensional vector each of whose entries is chosen from the standard Gaussian  distribution, and , then with probability at least , we have 
\end{fact}

\begin{fact} \label{fact:2stable} If  is a vector each of whose entries is chosen from the standard Gaussian  distribution, then for any vector  of the same dimension, the random variable  has Gaussian  distribution.
\end{fact}

The plan for the analysis is as follows. We will first analyze (in theorem \ref{thm:fq}) the network traffic of Layered LSH and derive a formula for it based on , the bin size of LSH function . We will see that as expected, increasing  reduces the network traffic, and our formula will show the exact relation between the two. We will next analyze (in theorem \ref{thm:rc}) the load balance of Layered LSH and derive a formula for it, again based on . Intuitively speaking, a large value of  tends to put all points on one or few machines, which is undesirable from the load balance perspective. Our analysis will formulate this dependence and show its exact form. These two results together will then show the exact tradeoff governing the choice of , which we will use to prove (in Corollary \ref{cor:Dsqrtk}) that with an appropriate choice of , Layered LSH achieves both network efficiency and load balance. Before proceeding to the analysis, we give a definition:
\begin{defn}
\label{defn:f} Having chosen LSH functions , for a query point , with offsets  (), define

to be the number of (Key, Value) pairs sent over the network for query .
\end{defn}

Since  is -dimensional, the network load due to query  is . Hence, to analyze the network efficiency of Layered LSH, it suffices to analyze . This is done in the following theorem:
\begin{thm} \label{thm:fq} For any query point , with high probability, that is probability at least , we have: 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Since for any offset , the value  is an integer, we have: 

For any vector , we have:  hence for any : 
Thus, from equation \ref{eq:fqmax}, we get:

From Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for inner products, we have for any :

Hence, we get:

For any , we know from lemma \ref{lem:trieq}: 

Furthermore for any , since

we know, using Fact \ref{fact:2stable}, that  is distributed as Gaussian . Now, recall from theorem \ref{thm:ELSH} that for our LSH function, . Hence, there is a constant  for which we have, using Fact \ref{fact:sharpcon}: 

with probability at least . Since, as explained in section \ref{sec:prelim}, all offsets are chosen from the surface of the sphere  of radius  centered at , we have: . Hence overall, for any :

with high probability. Then, since there are only  different choices of , and  is only polynomially large in , we get:

with high probability. Then, using equation \ref{eq:HGamma}, we get with high probability:

Furthermore, since each entry of  is distributed as , another application of Fact \ref{fact:sharpcon} gives (again with ): 

with high probability. Then, equations \ref{eq:fqnorms}, \ref{eq: Hbound}, and \ref{eq:alphabound} together give:

which finishes the proof. 
\end{proof}
\begin{rem} A surprising property of Layered LSH demonstrated by theorem \ref{thm:fq} is that the network load is independent of the number of query offsets, . Note that with Entropy LSH, to increase the search quality one needs to increase the number of offsets, which will then directly increase the network load. Similarly, with basic LSH, to increase the search quality one needs to increase the number of hash tables, which again directly increases the network load. However, with Layered LSH the network efficiency is achieved independently of the level of search quality. Hence, search quality can be increased without any effect on the network load! 
\end{rem}
Next, we proceed to analyzing the load balance of \algo. First, recalling the classic definition of error function:

we define the function :

and prove the following lemma:
\begin{lemma} For any two points  with , we have:
\label{lem:GueqGv}

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} Since  is uniformly distributed over , we have:

Then, since by Fact \ref{fact:2stable},  is distributed as Gaussian , we have:

\end{proof}

One can easily see that  is a monotonically increasing function, and for any  there exists a number  such that . Using this notation and the previous lemma, we prove the following theorem:

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:rc} For any constant , there is a  such that

and for any two points  with , we have:

where  is polynomially small in .
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let  be two points and denote . Then by lemma \ref{lem:trieq}, we have:

As in the proof of theorem \ref{thm:fq}, one can see, using  (from theorem \ref{thm:ELSH}) and Fact \ref{fact:sharpcon}, that there exists an  such that with probability at least  we have:

Hence, with probability at least , we have:

Now, letting:

we have if  then , and hence by lemma \ref{lem:GueqGv}:

which finishes the proof by recalling .
\end{proof}

Theorems \ref{thm:fq}, \ref{thm:rc} show the tradeoff governing the choice of parameter . Increasing  reduces network traffic at the cost of more skewed load distribution. We need to choose  such that the load is balanced yet the network traffic is low. Theorem \ref{thm:rc} shows that choosing  does not asymptotically help with the distance threshold at which points become likely to be sent to different machines. On the other hand, theorem \ref{thm:rc} also shows that choosing  is undesirable, as it unnecessarily skews the load distribution. To observe this more clearly, recall that intuitively speaking, the goal in Layered LSH is that if two data point  hash to the same values as two of the offsets  (for some ) of a query point  (i.e.,  and ), then  are likely to be sent to the same machine. Since  has a bin size of , such pair of points  most likely have distance . Hence,  should be only large enough to make points which are  away likely to be sent to the same machine. Theorem \ref{thm:rc} shows that to do so, we need to choose  such that:

that is . Then, by theorem \ref{thm:fq}, to minimize the network traffic, we choose , and get . This is summarized in the following corollary:

\begin{corol}
\label{cor:Dsqrtk}
Choosing , Layered LSH guarantees that the number of (Key,Value) pairs sent over the network per query is  with high probability, and yet points which are  away get sent to different machines with constant probability.
\end{corol}

\begin{rem} Corollary \ref{cor:Dsqrtk} shows that, compared to the simple distributed implementation of Entropy LSH and basic LSH, Layered LSH exponentially improves the network load, from  to , while maintaining the load balance across the different machines. 
\end{rem}

In this section, we present an experimental comparison of Simple and Layered LSH via the MapReduce framework with respect to the network cost (shuffle size) and ``wall-clock" run time for a number of data sets. Secondly, we compare Layered LSH in Section~\ref{sec:distlsh} with {\bf Sum} and {\bf Cauchy} distributed LSH schemes described in Haghani et al. \cite{Haghani}. Finally, we also analyze the results by considering the load balance properties.  

\subsection{Datasets} 
First, we describe the data sets we used.   
\begin{itemize}
\item{ \bf Random:}  
This data set is constructed by sampling points from \footnote{ denotes the normal distribution around the origin, , where the -th coordinate of a randomly chosen point has the distribution , } with  and the queries are generated by adding a small perturbation drawn from  to a randomly chosen data point, where . We use 1M data points and 100K queries. This ``planted'' data set has been used for LSH experiments in \cite{DIIM04} and we solve the -NN problem on it with . The parameter choice is such that for each query point, the expected distance to its closest data point is  and that with high probability only that data point is within distance  from it.





\item{\bf Wiki\footnote{http://download.wikimedia.org}:}
We use the English Wikipedia corpus from February 2012 to compute TF-IDF vectors for each document in it after removing stop words, stemming, and removing insignificant words (appearing fewer than  times in the corpus). We partition the 3.75M articles in the corpus randomly into a data set of size 3M and a query set of size 750K. We solve the -NN problem with  and . 

\item{\bf Image \cite{TinyImages}:} 
The Tiny Image Data set consists of almost M ``tiny" images of size  pixels \cite{TinyImages}. We extract a 64-dimensional color histogram from each image in this data set using the {\it extractcolorhistogram} tool in the FIRE image search engine, as described in \cite{Charikar:multiprobe, Fire} and normalize it to unit norm in the preprocessing step. 1M Data points and 200K queries are sampled randomly ensuring no overlap. The avg. distance of a query to its closest data point is estimated, through sampling, to be  (with standard deviation ), and hence, we solve the -NN problem on this data set with .  
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{ l | c | r }
  Data set & No. of data points & No. of queries \\
  \hline                        
  Random & 1M & 100K \\
  Wiki & 3M & 750K \\
  Image & 1M & 200K \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

We perform experiments on a small cluster of  compute nodes using Hadoop \cite{Hadoop} with MB JVMs to implement Map and Reduce tasks. Consistency in the choice of hash functions  (Section \ref{sec:distlsh}) as well as offsets across mappers and reducers is ensured by setting the seed of the random number generator appropriately. 

We choose the LSH parameters  for the Random data set,  for the Image data set, and  for the Wiki data set according to the calculations in \cite{P06}, and experiments in \cite{Charikar:multiprobe, bayes}. We optimized , the parameter of Layered LSH, using a simple binary search to minimize the wall-clock run time.

Since the underlying dimensionality (vocabulary size ) for the Wiki data set is large, we use the Multi-Probe LSH (MPLSH) \cite{Charikar:multiprobe} as our first layer of hashing for that data set. We discuss MPLSH in detail in Section \ref{sec:rel}. 
We measure the accuracy of search results by computing the recall, i.e., the fraction of query points with at least one data point within a distance , returned in the output. 

\subsection{Results} 
\begin{figure}

\caption{Variation in wall-clock run time for the ``Sum'', ``Cauchy'' and Layered LSH schemes with increasing  }
\label{Layer:runtime}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Comparison with Simple LSH:} 
Figure \ref{L} describes the results of scaling , the number of offsets per query, on the recall, shuffle size and wall-clock run time using a single hash table. Note that the recall of Entropy LSH can be improved by using  hash tables. Since improving recall is not the main aspect of this paper, we use just a single hash table for all our experiments. We observe that even with a crude binary search for , on average Layered LSH provides a factor 3 improvement over simple LSH in the wall-clock run time on account of a factor 10 or more decrease in the shuffle size. Further, improving recall by increasing  results in a linear increase in the shuffle size for Simple LSH, while, the shuffle size for Layered LSH remains almost constant. This observation verifies Theorem \ref{thm:fq} and Remark . Note that since Hadoop offers checkpointing guarantees where (Key, Value) pairs output by mappers and reducers may be written to the disk, Layered LSH also decreases the amount of data written to the distributed file system. 

\item{\bf Comparison with the ``Sum'' and ``Cauchy'' distributed LSH schemes described in \cite{Haghani}:}
We compare Layered LSH with {\bf Sum} and {\bf Cauchy} distributed LSH schemes described in Haghani et al. \cite{Haghani}. Figure \ref{Layer:runtime} shows that Layered LSH compares favorably with {\bf Cauchy} scheme \footnote{associated parameter chosen via a crude binary search to minimize runtime} for the Wiki data set. The MapReduce job for {\bf Sum} failed due to reduce task running out of memory, indicating load imbalance\footnote{Recall that reduce tasks store data points in memory}. This can be also seen as a manifestation of ``the curse of the last reducer'' \cite{curselast}.

\end{enumerate} 

{\bf Load Balance:}
Next, we discuss the distribution (average and max) of data points in the Wiki data set to  reduce tasks for the different distribution schemes. 

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l | c | r }
   & Average & Max \\
  \hline                        
  Simple LSH & 3K & 9K \\
  Sum & 3K & 214K \\
  Cauchy & 3K & 45K \\
  Layered LSH & 3K & 103K \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Wiki data set: distribution of data points across  reduce tasks}
\label{table:lb}
\end{center}
\end{table}


First, Table \ref{table:lb} above demonstrates {\bf Sum} has the most imbalanced load distribution, explaining its failure on MapReduce. Second, Simple LSH, while having the best load balance for the Wiki data set, incurs a large network cost in order to achieve this load balance. In contrast, Layered LSH offers a tunable way of trading off load balance to decrease network cost and minimize the wall-clock run time. Although {\bf Cauchy} compares favorably to Layered LSH in load balance, it is worse of in running time. In addition, it is not clear if it is possible to provide any theoretical guarantees for the {\bf Cauchy} scheme.



\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:rel}  

\comment{
The methods proposed in the literature for similarity search via nearest neighbors (NN) can be, broadly speaking, classified to data or space partitioning methods and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques. Space partitioning methods, such as -D trees \cite{Bentley:kdtree}, and data partitioning methods, such as R-trees \cite{Rtrees} and SR-trees \cite{SRtrees}, solve the NN problem by pruning the set of candidates for each query using branch and bound techniques. However, they do not scale well with the data dimension, and can in fact be even slower than a brute force sequential scan of the data set when the dimension exceeds  \cite{expt:space:partitioning}. For further details on these methods the reader is referred to the survey by Fodor \cite{Fodor}. 
}

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) was introduced by Indyk and Motwani in order to solve high dimensional similarity search problems \cite{im98}. 
LSH indexing methods are based on LSH families of hash functions for which near points have a higher likelihood of hashing to the same value. Then, -NN problem can be solved by using multiple hash tables. Gionis et al. \cite{gim99} showed that in the Euclidian space  hash tables suffice, which was later improved, by Datar et al. \cite{DIIM04}, to  (for some ), and further, by Andoni and Indyk \cite{AI06}, to  which almost matches the lower bound proved by Motwani et al. \cite{MNP06}. LSH families are also known for several non-Euclidian metrics, such as Jaccard distance \cite{Broder} and cosine similarity \cite{C02}. 

The main problem with LSH indexing is that to guarantee a good search quality, it requires a large number of hash tables. This entails a large index space requirement, and in the distributed setting, also a large amount of network communication per query. To mitigate the space inefficiency, Panigrahy \cite{P06} proposed Entropy LSH which, by also looking up the hash buckets of  random query ``offsets'', requires just  hash tables, and hence provides a large space improvement. But, Entropy LSH does not help with and in fact worsens the network inefficiency of conventional LSH: each query, instead of  network calls, one per hash table, requires  calls, one per offset. Our Layered LSH scheme exponentially improves this and, while guaranteeing a good load balance, requires only  network calls per query.

To reduce the number of offsets required by Entropy LSH, Lv et al. \cite{Charikar:multiprobe} proposed the Multi-Probe LSH (MPLSH) heuristic, in which a query-directed probing sequence is used instead of random offsets. They experimentally show this heuristic improves the number of required offset lookups. In a distributed setting, this translates to a smaller number of network calls per query and Layered LSH can be implemented by using MPLSH instead of Entropy LSH as the first ``layer'' of hashing, as demonstrated by experiments on the Wiki data set in section \ref{sec:exp}. Hence, the benefits of the two methods can be combined in practice.

However, the experiments by Lv et al. \cite{Charikar:multiprobe} show a modest constant factor reduction in the number of offsets compared to Entropy LSH. Hence, since Layered LSH, besides a theoretical exponential improvement, experimentally shows a factor  reduction in network load compared to Entropy LSH, it is not clear if the marginal benefit from switching the first layer to MPLSH is significant enough to justify its much more complicated offset generation. Furthermore, MPLSH has no theoretical guarantees, while using Entropy LSH as the first layer of hashing allows for the strong theoretical guarantees on both network cost and load balance of Layered LSH proved in this paper. Hence overall, in this paper, we focus on Entropy LSH as the first layer of hashing in Layered LSH.}

Haghani et al. \cite{Haghani} describe the {\bf Sum} and {\bf Cauchy} schemes which map LSH buckets to peers in p2p networks in order to minimize network costs. However, in contrast to Layered LSH, no guarantees on network cost and load balance are provided. In this paper, we show via MapReduce experiments on the Wiki data set that {\bf Sum} distributes data unevenly and thus may load some of the reduce tasks. In addition we also describe experiments which demonstrate that Layered LSH compares favorably with {\bf Cauchy} on this data set. 

\comment{Haghani et al. \cite{Haghani} and Wadhwa et al. \cite{wadhwa} study implementations of LSH via distributed hash tables on p2p networks aimed at improving network load by careful distribution of buckets on peers. However, they only provide heuristic methods restricted to p2p networks. Even though the basic idea of putting nearby buckets on the same machines is common between their heuristics and our Layered LSH, our scheme works on any framework in the general distributed (Key, Value) model (including not only MapReduce and Active DHT but also p2p networks) and provides the strong theoretical guarantees proved in this work for network efficiency and load balance in this general distributed model.}

1. Layered LSH can be simply implemented on top of Multi-Probe LSH
2. Multi-Probe LSH has no theoretical guarantee
3. Based on Lv et al.'s experiments, it only provides a small constant factor improvement in the number of required offsets, while Layered LSH provably provides an exponential improvement in the number of network calls, and in practice also improves the network communication by a factor of .  
4. Generating the probing sequence is more computationally intensive than just generating random offsets. This can further slow down the scheme in the distributed setting in which offsets need to be regenerated. 

LSH families are known for several other metric spaces like min-wise independent permutations for Jaccard similarity \cite{Broder} and SimHash for dot product or cosine similarity \cite{C02}. As noted earlier, LSH based indexing schemes require a large number of hash tables for accurate search results and a simple distributed implementation of the LSH indexing scheme (Simple LSH in Section \ref{sec:bckgrnd}, and described in \cite{google-news} ) will cause a large load on the network while processing queries.

Indyk and Motwani introduced Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) which involves hashing points to buckets such that near by points have a high chance of getting hashed to the same bucket \cite{im98}. Given parameters  and , a -LSH is family of hash functions such that the probability that two points separated by a distance at most  are hashed to the same bucket is at least , while the probability that two points separated by a distance at least  are hashed to the same bucket is at most .  Gionis \etal showed that using a -LSH, the -NN problem in the Euclidean space can be solved by the construction of an index consisting of  hash tables with run time  \cite{gim99}. The exponent exponent  was improved to  for some constant  by Datar \etal  using LSH family based on -stable distributions \cite{DIIM04} and further improved to  by Andoni and Indyk \cite{AI06}, which is almost optimal considering the lower bound proved by Motwani \etal \cite{MNP06}. In addition to the Euclidean space, LSH families are known for several other metric spaces like min-wise independent permutations for Jaccard similarity \cite{Broder} and SimHash for dot product similarity \cite{C02}.

\comment{
In order to improve space efficiency of LSH based methods, Panigrahy proposed the Entropy LSH scheme which randomly chooses  ``offsets" in the neighborhood of each query and searches the buckets to which these offsets get hashed to and showed that the -NN problem can be solved using only  hash tables using Entropy LSH. However this improvement in space efficiency comes at the cost of a higher network load ( from  per query) for the Entropy LSH( in a simple distributed LSH implementation (\ref{sec:bckgrnd}). In this paper, we describe an alternate distributed implementation, Layered LSH, which incurs only  network cost per query, an exponential improvement. Remarkably, increasing the number of offsets per query for improving the accuracy of LSH, does not increase the per query network cost of Layered LSH. 

 
Based on Panigrahy's work, Lv \etal described a query directed probing sequence for searching buckets for improving query processing  \cite{Charikar:multiprobe}. However, their approach is heuristic and they demonstrate a only constant factor reduction in the number of hash tables/offsets required. In contrast, Layered LSH offers a provable guarantee on network efficiency and an exponential improvement in network cost. We also note that the query dependent probing approach is orthogonal to our contribution, and our methods can easily be adapted to implement a query directed probing sequence on each node of a distributed LSH implementation to improve space efficiency and query processing. 



Haghani \etal, and Wadhwa \etal describe implementation of LSH via distributed hash tables on p2p networks aimed at improving network load by efficient distribution of buckets on peers and develop query processing algorithms in this setting \cite{Haghani, wadhwa}. However, these approaches are heuristic and restricted to p2p networks in contrast to provable guarantees on network efficiency and load balance described in this work. Also, our algorithms and analyses are in the abstract (Key, Value) setting and imply similar guarantees in particular case of p2p networks.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

We presented and analyzed Layered LSH, an efficient distributed implementation of LSH similarity search indexing. We proved that, compared to the straightforward distributed implementation of LSH, Layered LSH exponentially improves the network load, while maintaining a good load balance. Our analysis also showed that, surprisingly, the network load of Layered LSH is independent of the search quality. Our experiments confirmed that Layered LSH results in significant network load reductions as well as runtime speedups.  

\comment{
In this paper, we describe a network efficient distributed implementation, Layered LSH, which exponentially reduces network costs relative to the naive implementation while maintaining load balance. Surprisingly, we show that the network cost associated with Layered LSH are independent of the desired accuracy of LSH.
