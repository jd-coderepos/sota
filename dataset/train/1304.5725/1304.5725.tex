\begin{abstract}
One of the major challenges in design of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to reduce energy consumption of sensor nodes to prolong lifetime of finite-capacity batteries. In this paper, we propose Energy-efficient Adaptive Scheme for Transmission (EAST) in WSNs. EAST is an IEEE 802.15.4 standard compliant. In this scheme, open-loop is used for temperature-aware link quality estimation and compensation. Whereas, closed-loop feedback process helps to divide network into three logical regions to minimize overhead of control packets. Threshold on transmitter power loss  and current number of nodes () in each region help to adapt transmit power level () according to link quality changes due to temperature variation. Evaluation of propose scheme is done by considering  mobile sensor nodes and reference node both static and mobile. Simulation results show that propose scheme effectively adapts transmission  to changing link quality with less control packets overhead and energy consumption as compared to classical approach with single region in which maximum transmitter  assigned to compensate temperature variation.

\section{Introduction}

WSNs are currently being considered for many applications; including industrial, security surveillance, medical, environmental and weather monitoring. Due to limited battery lifetime at each sensor node; minimizing transmitter  to increase energy efficiency and network lifetime is useful. Sensor nodes consist of three parts; sensing unit, processing unit and transceiver~\cite{1}. Limited battery requires low power sensing, processing and communication system. Energy efficiency is of paramount interest and optimal WSN  should consume minimum amount of power.

In WSNs, sensor nodes are widely deployed in different environments to collect data. As sensor nodes usually operate on limited battery, so each sensor node communicate using a low power wireless link and link quality varies significantly due to environmental dynamics like temperature, humidity etc. Therefore, while maintaining good link quality between sensor nodes we need to reduce energy consumption for data transmission to extend network lifetime~\cite{2}, ~\cite{3}, ~\cite{4}. IEEE802.15.4 is a standard used for low energy, low data rate applications like WSN. This standard operate at  frequency  2.45 GHz with  channels up to 16 and  data rate  250 kbps.

To efficiently compensate link quality changes due to temperature variations, we propose a new scheme for  control EAST, that improves network lifetime while achieving required reliability between sensor nodes. This scheme is based on combination of open-loop and closed-loop feedback processes in which we divide network into three regions on basis of threshold on  for each region. In open-loop process, each node estimates link quality using its temperature sensor. Estimated link quality degradation is then effectively compensated using closed-loop feedback process by applying propose scheme. In closed-loop feedback process, appropriate transmission  control is obtained  which assign substantially less power than those required in existing transmission power control schemes.

Rest of the paper is organized as follows: section II briefs the related existing work and motivation for this work. In section III, we provide the readers with our proposed scheme. In section IV, we model our proposed scheme. Experimental results have been given in section V.

\section{Related Work and Motivation}

To transmit data efficiently over wireless channels in WSNs, existing schemes set some minimum transmission  for maintaining reliability. These schemes either decrease interference among sensor nodes or increase unnecessary energy consumption. In order to adjust transmission , reference node periodically broadcasts a beacon message. When nodes hear a beacon message from a reference node, nodes transmit an ACK message. Through this interaction, reference node estimate connectivity between nodes.

In Local Mean Algorithm (LMA), a reference node broadcasts LifeMsg message. Nodes transmit LifeAckMsg after they receive LifeMsg. Reference nodes count number of LifeAckMsgs and transmission  to maintain appropriate connectivity. For example, if number of LifeAckMsgs is less than NodeMinThresh; transmission  is increased. In contrast, if number of LifeAckMsgs is more than NodeMaxThresh transmission;  is decreased. As a result, they provide improvement of network lifetime in a sufficiently connected network. However, LMA only guarantees connectivity between nodes and cannot estimate link quality~\cite{5}.

Local Information No Topology/Local Information Link-state Topology (LINT/LILT) and Dynamic Transmission Power Control (DTPC) use  to estimate transmitter . Nodes exceeding threshold   are regarded as neighbor nodes with reliable links. Transmission  also controlled by Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) metric. As for the neighbor selection method, three different methods have been used in the literature: connectivity based, PRR based and  based. In LINT/LILT, a node maintains a list of neighbors whose  values are higher than the threshold , and it adjusts the radio transmission  if number of neighbors is outside the predetermined bound. In LMA/LMN, a node determines its range by counting how many other nodes acknowledged to the beacon message it has sent ~\cite{6}.

Adaptive Transmission Power Control (ATPC) adjusts transmission  dynamically according to spatial and temporal effects. This scheme tries to adapt link quality that changes over time by using closed-loop feedback. However, in large-scale WSNs, it is difficult to support scalability due to serious overhead required to adjust transmission  of each link. The result of applying ATPC is that every node knows the proper transmission  to use for each of its neighbors, and every node maintains good link qualities with its neighbors by dynamically adjusting the transmission  through on-demand feedback packets. Uniquely, ATPC adopts a feedback-based and pairwise transmission  control. By collecting the link quality history, ATPC builds a model for each neighbor of the node. This model represents an in-situ correlation between transmission  and link qualities. With such a model, ATPC tunes the transmission  according to monitored link quality changes. The changes of transmission  reflect changes in the surrounding environment ~\cite{7}.

Existing approaches estimate variety of link quality indicators by periodically broadcasting a beacon message. In addition, feedback process is repeated for adaptively controlling transmission . In adapting link quality for environmental changes, where temperature variation occur, packet overhead for transmission  control should be minimized. Reducing number of control packets while maintaining reliability is an important technical issue ~\cite{8}.

Radio communication quality between low power sensor devices is affected by spatial and temporal factors. The spatial factors include the surrounding environment, such as terrain and the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Temporal factors include surrounding environmental changes in general, such as weather conditions (Temperature). To establish an effective transmission  control mechanism, we need to understand the dynamics between link quality and  values. Wireless link quality refers to the radio channel communication performance between a pair of nodes. PRR is the most direct metric for link quality. However, the PRR value can only be obtained statistically over a long period of time.  can be used effectively as binary link quality metrics for transmission  control~\cite{9}.

Radio irregularity results in radio signal strength variation in different directions, but the signal strength at any point within the radio transmission range has a detectable correlation with transmission power in a short time period.  There are three main reasons for the fluctuation in the . First, fading causes signal strength variation at any specific distance. Second, the background noise impairs the channel quality seriously when the radio signal is not significantly stronger than the noise signal. Third, the radio hardware doesn’t provide strictly stable functionality~\cite{10}.

Since the variation is small, this relation can be approximated by a linear curve. The correlation between  and transmission  is approximately linear.  Correlation between transmission  and  is largely influenced by environments, and this correlation changes over time. Both the shape and the degree of variation depend on the environment. This correlation also dynamically fluctuates when the surrounding environmental conditions change. The fluctuation is continuous, and the changing speed depends on many factors, among which the degree of environmental variation is one of the main factors~\cite{11}.

Propose energy efficient transmission scheme EAST helps efficiently compensate link quality changes due to temperature variation. To reduce packet overhead for adaptive power control temperature measured by sensors is utilized to adjust transmission  for all  three regions based on . Compared to single region in which large control packets overhead occur even due to small change in link quality. Closed-loop feedback process is executed to minimize control packets overhead and required transmitter .

\section{Proposed Energy Efficient Transmission Scheme}

In this section, we present energy efficient transmission scheme that maintains link quality during temperature variation in wireless environment. It utilizes open-loop process based on sensed temperature information according to temperature variation. Closed-loop feedback process based on control packets is further used to accurately adjust transmission . By adopting both open-loop and closed-loop feedback processes we divide network into three regions A, B, C for high, medium and low  respectively.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{BD.eps}
\caption{Block Diagram}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to assign minimum and reachable transmission  to each link EAST is designed. EAST has two phases that is initial and run-time. In initial phase reference node build a model for nodes in network. In run-time phase based on previous model EAST adapt the link quality to dynamically maintain each link with respect to time. In a relatively stable network, control overhead occurs only in measuring link quality in initial phase. But in a relatively unstable network because link quality is continuously changing initial phase is repeated and serious overhead occur. Before we present block diagram for proposed scheme some variables are defined as follows (1)Current nodes in a region  (2) Desired nodes in a region  (3) Error: e(t) = ,(4) .

\caption{Flow chart of Reference Node}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}


Fig1 shows system block diagram of proposed scheme. PRR, ACK, and  used to determine connectivity. ACK estimates connectivity but it cannot determine link quality. PRR estimates connectivity accurately but it causes significant overhead ~\cite{8}. In our scheme, we use  for connectivity estimation, which measures connectivity with relatively low overhead.

Power controller adjusts transmission  by utilizing both number of current nodes and temperature sensed at each node. Since power controller is operated not merely by comparing number of current nodes with desired nodes but by using temperature-compensated , so that it can reach to desired  rapidly. If temperature is changing then temperature compensation is executed on basis of relationship between temperature and . Network connectivity maintained with low overhead by reducing feedback process between nodes which is achieved due to logical division of network.

Transmission power loss due to temperature variation formulated using relationship between  and temperature experimented in Bannister et al.. Mathematical expression for  due to temperature variation is as follows ~\cite{12}:



To compensate  estimated from Eq.(1) we have to control output  of radio transmitter accordingly. Relationship between required transmitter  and  is formulated by Eq.(2) using least square approximation ~\cite{12}:



Based on Eqs (1, 2), we obtain appropriate  to compensate  due to temperature variation. To compensate path loss due to distance  between each sensor node in WSN, free space model helps to estimate actual required transmitter power. After addition of  due to temperature variation in Eq.(3), we estimate actual required transmitter power between each sensor node. For free space path loss model  we need number of nodes in a network (N), distance between each node (d), () depends upon (), spectral efficiency (), frequency () and receiver noise figure ():
 

Parameters for propose scheme are,(1) Threshold   for each region. (2) Desired nodes in each region , (3) Transmission power level  for each region.

Threshold  is minimum value required to maintain link reliability. Reference node broadcasts beacon message periodically to nodes and wait for ACKs. If ACKs are received from nodes then  is estimated for logical division of network, number of nodes with high   considered in region A, medium  considered in region B, and with low  in region C. If (   Threshold) and  () then Threshold transmitter  assigned if  for similar case () then similar transmitter  assigned and if  (    Threshold) then by default keep same transmitter . Given below is an algorithm for EAST.

Fig2 shows complete flow chart for reference node. Node senses temperature by using locally installed sensor and checks if temperature change detected. If there is any temperature change, compensation process is executed on the basis of Eqs (1, 2). Nodes send an ACK message including temperature change information with a newly calculated . Apply ing this temperature-aware compensation scheme we can reduce overhead caused by conventional scheme in changing temperature environments.

\section{Mathematical Representation of the Proposed Scheme}
Let suppose we have 100 nodes in a network that are randomly deployed represented as (). Nodes are  placed at different locations in a square area of 100*100m and distance () between them is from 1 to 100m. For given environment temperature () can have values  in range
-10    53     i  N.\\

Relation between and  is formulated by using a least square approximation~\cite{12}:\\

Maximum, minimum and average value of   for all nodes in network can be formulated as:\\





After finding maximum and minimum values of  we will define upper and lower limit of  to divide network into three regions and also set counter to count number of nodes in each region.

To apply our proposed scheme  we need to define threshold on  for each region for energy efficient communication between sensor nodes. Threshold on  for each region depends upon  of all nodes in a particular region and number of nodes in that region. Threshold on  for each region is defined as:\\

\section{Results and Discussions}

In this section, we describe simulation results of proposed technique for energy efficient transmission in WSNs. Simulation parameters are; rounds 1200, temperature -10-53 , distance (1-100)m, nodes 100, regions A,B,C,  0.0029, SNR 0.20dB, bandwidth 83.5MHz, frequency 2.45GHz, RNF 5dB, T 300k,   8.3dB.  In Fig3 we have shown values of meteorological temperature for one round that each sensor node have sensed. Let suppose we have 100 nodes in 100*100  square region and temperature can have values in range (-10 - 53)  ~\cite{13} for given meteorological condition of Pakistan. Reference node is placed at edge of this region.

Different values of temperature for each sensor node based on meteorological condition  helps to estimate . Fig4 shows  due to temperature variation in any environment using the relationship between  and temperature  given by Bannister et al.  High   means that sensor node  placed in region where temperature is high so link not have good quality. For temperature (-10 - 53)   have value in range (-6dBm) - (5dBm).

From Fig4 it is also clear that link quality and  have inverse relation, when temperature is high  has high value means low quality link and vise versa. After estimating  for each node in WSN we compute corresponding transmitter  to compensate .  Fig5 shows range of  on y-axis for given  that is between (20- 47) and also variation of required  for sensor node with changing temperature that is at low temperature required  is low and for high temperature required  is high.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.32]{plevelabc.eps}
\caption{Power level using Classical Approach for regions A, B, and C}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As we have earlier estimated  for each sensor node on the basis of given meteorological temperature that helps to estimate required  to compensate . That power level only helps to compensate  due to temperature variations. To compensate path loss due to distance  between each sensor node in WSNs, free space model helps to estimate actual required transmitter power. After addition of required  due to temperature variation and distance, we estimate actual required  between each sensor node. Fig6 shows required   including both  due to temperature variation and free space path loss for different nodes. We clearly see from figure that  lies between (-175 - 90) and most of times it is above -120 .

\end{figure}

In Fig7, we have shown  using classical approach for three regions and in Fig8,  for the proposed technique; EAST. We can clearly see the difference between  assigned. To show  for each region, we take the difference between the assigned s using EAST and classical technique, as can be seen in the figures 9, 10, 11. As we know that in classical approach, there is no concept of sub regions, so, for the sake of comparison with the proposed technique; EAST, we have shown  for different regions using classical approach.

After estimating  for nodes of each region, we have estimated required  for nodes of each region that we clearly see in Fig7, in region A,  lies between (40-45), for region B (30-35) and for region C (20-25). It means that for region A required  high than both other region that also shows that for that region temperature and  is large. For region B required  is between both region A and C and for C region required  is less than both other two regions. We have earlier seen in Fig7  for each region assigned using classical approach. After applying proposed technique we see what  required for each region. We can clearly see difference  between  as shown in Fig8, that required  decreases for each region and for region A it decreases maximum. Fig9,10,11 respectively  shows required  for region A,B and C after implanting proposed technique.  up to 2.3 for region A, 1.7 for B and 1.5 for C.

Fig12 describes the effect of reference node mobility on  for region A.   Reference node move around boundaries of  square region and nodes in a region  considered to be static. When reference node is at center location (50, 50) of network maximum nodes around reference node have large  than threshold so we need to reduce  to meet threshold  requirement that cause maximum .  We can clearly see maximum  12dBm to 20dBm for center location.  When reference  node move  from center to one of  the corner (0, 0) of square region  remains constant approximately around 1dB, fact is that number of nodes near reference node region having same  mean constant temperature and they need approximately same  near threshold.  for reference node movement from (0, 0) to (0, 100) fluctuate between -5dBm - 6dBm and at two moments we observe maximum  because number of nodes near reference node have to increase their  to meet threshold is minimum.

Movement of reference node from (0, 100) to (100, 100) causes  between -4dBm - 12dBm and only one time peak . Similarly when reference node move from (100, 100) to (100, 0)  remains in limits between -4dBm- 7dBm and only one time maximum  . From this figure it is also clear that for region A reference node location at center gives maximum  that enhances network lifetime. We can also see variation of  with respect to time that basically depends upon nodes near reference node have what  if nodes have less  then threshold then we have to increase  that decrease  and if nodes have large  then threshold then we need to decrease  that enhances . It is also clear from result that peak maximum and minimum  comes at same time.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.32]{pa.eps}
\caption{ Transmitter power save in region A for different Reference Node Locations}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Similarly we can see  for similar pattern of reference node mobility considering regions B and C. For region B in Fig13 when reference node at center location (50, 50)   remains between 14dBm-20dBm, from center to (0, 0)  remains between 0 - 1dBm. When reference node moves from (0, 0) to one of the corner of square region (0, 100)   fluctuate between 0 - 4dBm. Reference node movement from (0, 100) to (100, 100)  cause  -1dBm-5dBm. Reference node movement from (100, 100) to (100, 0)  -4dBm-5dBm.

This figure also indicates  that  for region B is maximum when reference node at center location. For reference node mobility from center to (0, 0)  remains constant due to constant  near reference node region. For other reference node movements  remains approximately constant due to less variations in . Compared to region A where  goes to peak maximum and minimum value in region B  remains on average approximately constant and less variation occurs,  fact is that nodes in region B have approximately same  near threshold.

 for reference node mobility in region C around square as shown in Fig14. When reference node is at center (50, 50)   fluctuates between 8dBm-50dBm. From center to edge (0, 0) reference node mobility cause  around 0dBm. When reference node move from corner of square (0, 0) to corner (0, 100)  -5dBm-12dBm. Similarly from (0, 100) to (100, 100)  remains between -10dBm-18dBm.  Finally when reference node location changes from (100, 100) to (100, 0)  goes to maximum value 60dBm that shows that nodes near reference node have large  than threshold  at that moment. This figure also elaborates that on average  maximum for reference node location at center. Compared to region B in this region peak maximum and minimum  exists reason is that nodes in this region have large  than threshold at that moment.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we presented a new proposed technique  EAST. It shows that temperature is one of most important factors impacting link quality. Relationship between  and temperature has been analyzed for our transmission power control scheme. Proposed scheme uses open-loop control to compensate for changes of link quality according to temperature variation. By combining both open-loop temperature-aware compensation and close-loop feedback control, we can significantly reduce overhead of transmission power control in WSN, we  further extended our scheme by dividing network into three regions on basis of threshold  and assign  to each node in three regions on the basis of current number of nodes and desired number of nodes, which helps to adapt  according to link quality variation and increase network lifetime. We have also evaluate the performance of propose scheme for reference node mobility around square region that shows  up to 60dBm. But in case of static reference node  goes maximum to 2dBm.

In future, firstly, we are interested to work on Internet Protocol (IP) based solutions in WSNs~\cite{14}. Secondly, as sensors are usually deployed in potentially adverse environments~\cite{15}, so, we will address the security challenges using the intrusion detection systems because they provide a necessary layer for the protection.
