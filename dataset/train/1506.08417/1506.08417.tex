\begin{abstract}
We consider a multiple access communication system where multiple users share a common collision channel.
Each user observes its local traffic and the feedback from the channel.
At each time instant the feedback from the channel is one of three messages: no transmission, successful transmission, collision.
The objective is to design a transmission protocol that coordinates the users' transmissions and achieves high throughput and low delay.

We present a decentralized Common Information-Based Multiple Access (CIMA) protocol that has the following features:
(i) it achieves the full throughput region of the collision channel;
(ii) it results in a delay that is linear in the number of users, and is significantly lower than that of CSMA protocols;
(iii) it avoids collisions without channel sensing.

\section{Introduction}

Multiple access communication has played a crucial role in the operation of many networked systems, including satellite networks, radio networks, wired/wireless Local Area Networks (LANs), and data centers.
One important feature of multiple access communication is its decentralized information structure.
In general, when multiple users share the communication system,
coordination among them is essential to resolve collision issues.
In the absence of a centralized controller, it is challenging to design efficient user coordination mechanisms.


We consider a typical slotted multiple access communication system where multiple users share a common collision channel.
Each user is equipped with an infinite size buffer and observes Bernoulli arrivals to its own queue.
In addition to the local information, all users receive a common broadcast feedback from the channel.
The feedback indicates whether the previous transmission was successful (exactly one user transmitted), or it was a collision (more than one users transmitted), or the channel was idle. The objective is to design a transmission protocol that effectively coordinates the users' transmissions under the above described information structure.
In the design of transmission protocols, there are two major performance metrics of interest: throughput and delay.
The throughput region of a protocol is the set of arrival rates for which the users' queues are stable (see detailed definition in Section \ref{sub:model:throughput}) under the protocol. The delay performance of a protocol is the average waiting time of a packet in the communication system. An efficient transmission protocol should achieve the maximum throughput region and incur low transmission delay.


In this paper, we propose a common information (see \cite{nayyar2013decentralized,nayyar2014common}) based multiple access protocol () that uses the common channel feedback to coordinate users. 
In , each user constructs upper bounds on the lengths of the queues of all users, including itself, based on previous transmission strategies and the common feedback.
Since the upper bounds are common knowledge, users can coordinate their transmission through these common upper bounds to avoid collision. 
We prove that without knowledge of any statistics,  achieves the full throughput region of the collision channel.
We also prove that the  protocol incurs low transmission delay; the delay is upper-bounded by a linear function of the number of users.

There is a rich literature on multiple access communications. 
Below we present a survey of this literature.

\subsection*{Related Work}

There are primarily two classes of protocols for the situation where the alphabet of the feedback channel is 
no transmission, successful transmission, collision:
collision-free and contention-based protocols.
Time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) \cite{rom1990multiple} and adaptive TDMA \cite{papadimitriou2003adaptive, papadimitriou2006high} are collision-free protocols.
In adaptive TDMA protocols the (common) information provided by the feedback is used to adaptively coordinate users to avoid collision.
Adaptation resolves the problems due to asymmetric arrivals, and collision avoidance results in higher throughput and lower delay than TDMA. However, there is no theoretical analysis of adaptive TDMA protocols.
Backoff-type protocols and Aloha protocols \cite{rom1990multiple} allow for contention/collision.
Due to collision, most contention based protocols can not achieve full throughput.
However, polynomial back-off protocols, presented and analyzed in \cite{haastad1996analysis}, achieve full throughput. Nevertheless, polynomial back-off protocols have exponential delay performance in simulation.


Several types of multiple access protocols were proposed when the common information among the users is more than .
The authors of \cite{shah2011medium, rajagopalan2009network, shah2012randomized} proposed decentralized random access protocols that achieve full throughput when each user knows the maximum queue length in the system or all other users' transmission results.
When channel sensing is allowed, carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols, proposed in \cite{jiang2010distributed, jiang2011approaching,ni2012q, ghaderi2013fundamental,jiang2012fast,lee2014provable}, achieve full throughput when the channel sensing portion of time is not taken into account in the throughput calculation.
A survey of CSMA protocols is presented in \cite{yun2012optimal}.
In terms of delay performance, the CSMA protocols proposed in \cite{jiang2012fast,lee2014provable} achieve delay that is linear in the number of users. 



Multiple access protocols for adversarial queueing models were presented in \cite{chlebus2012adversarial,anantharamu2009adversarial}.
In \cite{chlebus2012adversarial,anantharamu2009adversarial} it is proved that these protocols achieve full throughput and have linear delay in the number of users.


Other models for multiple access have also been proposed in the literature.
In \cite{wang2014optimal}, channel switching policies that achieve high throughput for multiple access have been considered within the context of the slotted Aloha protocol and the IEEE 802.11 WLANs protocol.
The stability region of the multi-packet reception multiple access channel has been investigated in \cite{luo2006throughput}.
Multiple access with noisy channels has been considered in \cite{ying2011throughput, reddy2012distributed}, and the stability region of policies with delayed shared information has been determined.







\subsection*{Contributions of the Paper}
We present a collision-free protocol () that achieves full throughput and delay that is linear in the number of users.
The protocol is based on the common information approach to decentralized decision-making \cite{nayyar2013decentralized}.
The common information in our problem is the feedback,  or , provided at each time instant to all the users by the collision channel. The protocol achieves lower delay than adaptive TDMA and back-off protocols. It also achieves lower delay than CSMA. CSMA protocols achieve delay that is linear in the number users, but it is significantly higher than that of . Furthermore, CSMA protocols require more communication and coordination among users than the  protocol.
The  protocol is simple to implement, as at each time instant it only requires knowledge of the upper bounds on each user's queue length. The upper bounds on the users' queue lengths are common knowledge and are updated in a simple manner.

\caption{Multiple Access Collision Channel}
\label{fig:system}
\end{figure}
We consider a slotted communication system, described by Fig. \ref{fig:system}, 
where  users, indexed by , 
share a common collision channel; we denote by  the set of channel users.
Each user  is associated with an infinite size buffer
with queue length  at the beginning of each time slot .
We assume that each queue is initially empty.

At each time slot  each user can transmit one packet in its queue through the shared channel.
If only one user transmits in a time slot, the transmission is successful and the transmitted packet is removed form the queue; if more than one users transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs and all packets involved in the collision remain in their queue.
We consider Bernoulli arrivals to the system.
Let  denote the packet arrival to user  at time ;
 means that a packet arrives at queue  right after the transmission at time .
The arrival  is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter , and the
arrival processes
 are independent.
Let  denote the transmission decision of user  at time slot ;  (resp. ) indicates that user  transmits (resp. does not transmit) at time . 
The dynamics of queues are given by

where .
We assume that at the end of each time slot , every user receives a feedback  from the channel/receiver indicating whether no packets, one packet, or more than one packet (a collision) were transmitted, respectively, in this time slot.
This communication system is decentralized; each user can only observe its own queue length, its arrivals and the common feedback.
Moreover, the arrival rates  are \textit{not known} to the users.
Therefore, the users' decisions according to any decentralized transmission policy/protocol  are generated by



In this paper, we consider throughput and queueing delay as the performance metrics of a decentralized transmission policy/protocol.
The objective is to design a decentralized protocol to achieve full throughput and to maintain low queueing delay. We proceed to define the throughput region and queueing delay of the communication system.


\subsection{Stability and Throughput Optimality}\label{sub:model:throughput}


For queueing systems that can be described by irreducible Markov chains,
stability is usually defined to be positive recurrence of the corresponding Markov chains.
In this problem, the users' actions can generally depend on the whole history of information.
When non-Markovian control policies are used, the resulting queue length processes are not Markov in general.
Even within the class of Markovian policies, the corresponding Markov chain may not be irreducible under any Markovian policy.

To achieve higher throughput performance of the communication system, we consider general 
non-Markovian policies of the form given by \eqref{eq:policy}. Therefore, a stability notion for general stochastic processes is essential for our analysis of the system. 
In this paper, we call a stochastic process  \textit{stable} if
for every  there exists a finite set  such that

This stability concept is also used in \cite{szpankowski1994stability,luo1999stability, borst2008stability}, and it is called bounded in probability in \cite{meyn2009markov}.
Note that the stability criterion \eqref{def:stability} is equivalent to positive recurrence for countable irreducible Markov chains \cite[Proposition 18.3.1]{meyn2009markov}. 
For general countable Markov chains with a reachable state, bounded in probability is equivalent to positive Harris recurrence, another stability concept for general Markov chains \cite[Proposition 18.3.2 ]{meyn2009markov}.





Given the arrival rates  to all queues, 
a policy/protocol  stabilizes the communication system if the resulting queue length process
 for every user  is stable.
The arrival rate  is said to be supportable if there exist policies/protocols that can stabilize the communication system under .

For any arrival rates , we use  to denote the total arrival rate to the communication system.
Since at most one packet can be transmitted through the collision channel at each time, only  could be supportable, where


Furthermore, any  is supportable by the time sharing policy that assigns  portion of time slots to user . 
Therefore, arrival rates  are supportable if and only if . We call  the throughput region of the multiple access communication system.
We call a decentralized policy/protocol throughput optimal if it can stabilize the communication system for any . 



\subsection{Queueing Delay} \label{sub:model:delay}
Let  denote total queue length of the system at time .
We define

From Little's law (see \cite{bertsekas1992data}), 
in a stable queueing system, the queueing delay of a packet is proportional to the average total number of packets in the system. 
For a throughput optimal protocol , the queueing delay of the system is given by .

\subsection{Objective}
Our objective is to find a throughput optimal protocol that results in low queueing delay.


\section{The Common Information-Based Multiple Access (CIMA) Protocol}
\label{sec:CIMA}
\subsection{Preliminaries}
We first introduce common upper bounds for the queues.
Let , where
 is the upper bound on  at time slot  based on the transmission protocol  and the common information , received from the common feedback, up to time slot .
That is, when ,

Note that,  is a function of the common information . We use  to denote that the common upper bounds depend explicitly on the transmission policy .

\subsection{The  Protocol}
\label{sub:ghat}
The  protocol is defined as follows.

where  is a function of common upper bounds  defined as

Note that  is the user with the largest common upper bound. Since we want to avoid collision, if there are more than one users with the largest common upper bound,  selects the user with the smallest index.



\section{Performance Analysis of the  Protocol}
\label{sec:analysis}
We prove that the  protocol is throughput optimal in \ref{sub:throughput}.
We provide an upper bound on the queueing delay under the  protocol in \ref{sub:delay}.

\subsection{Preliminary Results}
In order to analyze the system dynamics under the  protocol, we first provide the following result.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lm:conditional_indep}
Under the  protocol,
the queue lengths are independent conditional on the common feedback given any arrival rates .
Specifically, for any time , any realization  and any value  of ,

Moreover, the conditional probability can be updated as follows.
For 

For  and 

For  and 



\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
See Appendix \ref{app:lm1}.
\end{proof}


Using Lemma \ref{lm:conditional_indep}, we can obtain the evolution of queue lengths and common upper bounds under , as stated in the lemma below.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lm:evolution}
Under , the queue lengths evolve as

and the common upper bounds evolve according to

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
See Appendix \ref{app:lm2}.
\end{proof}
Using Lemma \ref{lm:evolution},
the  protocol can be easily implemented as described in Algorithm \ref{alg:g} below.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{The  protocol for user }

\ENDIF


\FOR{}
\STATE 
\ENDFOR

\IF{}
\STATE  
\ELSE
\STATE  
\ENDIF
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Throughput Optimality} \label{sub:throughput}
The main result on 's throughput is stated in the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:throughput_optimal}
The  protocol is throughput optimal.
That is, for any arrival rates  (defined by \eqref{eq:throughputregion}),
the queue length processes under  are stable.
\end{theorem}

To prove the theorem, we first show that under the  protocol the queue lengths together with the upper bounds form a Markov chain.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lm:MC}
Let , where

for every time slot 
Then,  is a Markov chain.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
See Appendix \ref{app:lm3}.
\end{proof}


Since  is a Markov chain, we can use the Foster-Lyapunov theorem in the proof below to show that the process  is stable.


\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:throughput_optimal}]
Let . Then  because .
Let .
Define the Lyapunov function  by

where .
For ,
let .
Then from \eqref{eq:Qunderg} and \eqref{eq:Bunderg} in Lemma \ref{lm:evolution} we get

(see Appendix \ref{app:thm} for a detailed derivation of \eqref{eq:stability1})
\\
Since ,  and  for all .
Define 

Then, \eqref{eq:stability1} holds for every .
Since  is a finite set, the Foster-Lyapunov drift criterion (Condition (DD2) in \cite{meyn1992stability}) is satisfied.
From \cite[Theorem 4.5]{meyn1992stability},  is bounded in probability (satisfies the stability condition \eqref{def:stability}).



Therefore, for every  there exists a finite set  such that

Let  be the projection of  on its th component.
Then,

Therefore,

also satisfies \eqref{def:stability} and the stability of the communication system under  is established.



\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
We provide an alternative proof of Theorem \ref{thm:throughput_optimal}.
\\
As a result of \eqref{eq:stability1}, condition (V2) in \cite[Chap. 11]{meyn2009markov} is satisfied.
Therefore, by Theorem 11.3.4 in \cite{meyn2009markov} the Markov chain  is positive Harris recurrent on a countable state space. By Theorem 18.3.2 in \cite{meyn2009markov} positive Harris recurrence implies \eqref{eq:bddinprob}, which in turn implies \eqref{eq:bddinprob2}, and this establishes the assertion of Theorem \ref{thm:throughput_optimal}.

\end{remark}
\subsection{Delay Performance} \label{sub:delay}

Using , we have the following queueing delay performance guarantee.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:delay}
Under the  protocol, for any rate  we have

\end{theorem}

Theorem \ref{thm:delay} says that for any fixed total arrival rate , the queuing delay under the  protocol is linear in the number of users . 

To prove Theorem \ref{thm:delay}, we first present a property of the  protocol.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lm:successfulq}
Let .
If the total number of packets at time  is , there are at least  successful transmissions from time  to  using the  protocol. That is




\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
See Appendix \ref{app:lm4}.
\end{proof}

Since  for each , ;  (respectively, ) denotes a successful (respectively, unsuccessful) transmission at time .
Lemma \ref{lm:successfulq} shows that when at a certain time slot the total queue length is ,
the  protocol can successfully transmit at least  packets in the next  time slots.


Using Lemma \ref{lm:successfulq}, we can now prove Theorem \ref{thm:delay}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:delay}]
Let , and define recursively the random variables  by

Then, each  is the time such that  packets are successfully transmitted
from time  to  under the  protocol.


By Lemma \ref{lm:successfulq} the  protocol can successfully transmit at least  packets from time
 to . Therefore

Consequently, from the dynamics of queues and \eqref{eq:Tk} we obtain

(see Appendix \ref{app:thm:delay} for a detailed derivation of \eqref{eq:QTkrec})
\\
Since , .
From \eqref{eq:QTkrec}, we can show, recursively, that for all 

Now for any time , for any realization of arrivals there is some number  such that  (). Using \eqref{eq:QTkbound} and the dynamics of queues we get

(see Appendix \ref{app:thm:delay} for a detailed derivation of \eqref{eq:qt})
\\
Since \eqref{eq:qt} holds for any time , we have


\end{proof}




\begin{remark}
The result of Theorem \ref{thm:delay} implies throughput optimality of the  protocol.
Since the bound on delay (the right hand side of \eqref{eq:delaybound}) is finite for every , it can be shown that the stability requirement described by \eqref{def:stability} is satisfied. Nevertheless, the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:throughput_optimal} is interesting/instructive by itself, and for this reason we have proved throughput optimality and delay performance separately.
\end{remark}

\section{Simulation Results}
\label{sec:simulation}

In this section we first compare, via simulation, the queueing delay incurred by  with 
that of three other protocols that use the same feedback information and no channel sensing: the basic TDMA protocol, the adaptive TDMA (ATDMA) protocol \cite{papadimitriou2003adaptive} and the quadratic back-off protocol which is proved to be throughput optimal in \cite{haastad1996analysis}. 
In the quadratic back-off protocol, each user transmits a packet with probability  where  is the back-off counter.
We also compare the delay performance of  with CSMA protocols proposed in\cite{chlebus2012adversarial,anantharamu2009adversarial}; these protocols employ channel sensing before transmission scheduling.

In the numerical experiments, we have used different values of  and  for each protocol.
Arrival rates are asymmetric: half of the users have arrival rate  and the other half of the users have arrival rate .
For each  and , we run the simulation for  time steps. 



The simulation results of Fig. \ref{fig:CIMA} show that the average delay associated with the  protocol is linear in the number of users. These simulation results are consistent with the result of Theorem \ref{thm:delay}.

In Fig. \ref{fig:Compare}, we compare the delay performance of TDMA, ATDMA, quadratic back-off and CIMA protocols for a system of  users.
Fig. \ref{fig:Compare} shows that the delay associated with the  protocol is significantly smaller than that of the quadratic back-off protocol (that is also throughput optimal) and of the TDMA protocol (note that TDMA is unstable when  ). 's delay is also smaller than the delay of ATDMA (note that there is no theoretical analysis for ATDMA).

In Fig. \ref{fig:Compare_CSMA}, we compare the delay performance of  with two CSMA protocols: 
the PGD protocol proposed in \cite{jiang2012fast}, and the DCSMA protocol proposed in \cite{lee2014provable}.
The results of \cite{jiang2012fast} and \cite{lee2014provable} prove that the two CSMA protocols achieve delay that is linear in the number of system users.
That is, the delay of the CSMA protocols is of the same order as the delay of the\  protocol.
However, channel sensing is required to implement the two CSMA protocols.
Moreover, Fig. \ref{fig:Compare_CSMA} shows that the delay resulting from the  protocol is significantly smaller than that of the CSMA protocols of \cite{jiang2012fast} and \cite{lee2014provable}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We developed a transmission protocol that utilizes the common information of the system's users to achieve efficient/optimal coordination of their transmissions.
The protocol is collisions free; thus, it is similar in spirit to TDMA (or adaptive TDMA), but it differs from TDMA in the way it selects the user to transmit at each time slot.
Intuitively, we expect that the delay due to the  protocol will increase linearly with the number of users. The result of Theorem \ref{thm:delay} confirms this intuition.

The problem investigated in this paper can be viewed as a decentralized control/decision-making problem with non-classical information structure \cite{witsenhausen1971separation}. Decentralized stochastic control problems with non-classical information structure are signaling problems \cite{ho1980team}. In our setup signaling occurs through the feedback provided by the collision channel. Signaling leads to adjustments of each user's upper bounds on their queue lengths (in the manner described by ) and results in efficient coordination among the users.
Signaling also occurs in CSMA protocols and in adaptive TDMA, but it is distinctly different from that of the  protocol.

Furthermore, \eqref{eq:conditional_update1} is established by \eqref{eq:lm_conditional2r_n} and \eqref{eq:lm_conditional2r_n0};
\eqref{eq:conditional_update2} is established by \eqref{eq:lm_conditional2r_v}, and \eqref{eq:conditional_update3} is established by \eqref{eq:lm_conditional2r_v0}.

For , from \eqref{eq:Qunderg} and \eqref{eq:Bunderg} in Lemma \ref{lm:evolution}, we obtain

where the last equality in \eqref{eq:app:thm:eq1v} follows from the fact that  is also independent of .
\\
substituting \eqref{eq:app:thm:eq1n} and \eqref{eq:app:thm:eq1v} back into \eqref{eq:app:thm:eq1} we get

\label{app:lm4}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lm:successfulq}]
The lemma holds if there is no unsuccessful transmission from time  to .
Otherwise, suppose the first unsuccessful transmission is from user  at time .
Since  and no packet is transmitted at time , every user will update the upper bound  for user .
From the evolution of the upper bounds we have

for any time  if user  is not selected again by  before time .

There are two possibilities: (1) user  is not selected by  again before time ; (2) user  is selected by  again at time  where .

First consider the case when user  is not selected by  again before time .
Then \eqref{eq:Bntau} holds for any time  from  to . 
From the specification of , if any other user  has an unsuccessful transmission at time , ,
for any subsequent time  we will have

Therefore, user  will not be selected by  again from time  to . Consequently, any user  can have at most one unsuccessful transmission from time  to .
Since any of the  users can have at most one unsuccessful transmission from time  to , the number of successful transmissions during this time period is at least .

Next consider the case when user  is selected by  again at time  where .
From the specification of , we must have  for user  to transmit at time .
Therefore, letting  in \eqref{eq:Bntau} we get

for all .
Let  be the number of successful transmissions for user  between time  and .
We prove in the following that .
\\
If user  has an unsuccessful transmission between  and , then the queue at user  is empty at the time of the unsuccessful transmission. Therefore,
 because all the  packets queued at time  are successfully transmitted by user  between time  and . 
\\
If user  transmits successfully in every time slot selected by , from \eqref{eq:Bmt2up} and the evolution of the upper bounds we obtain

Since , \eqref{eq:Smlb2pre} implies

Consequently, for every user 

Note that the total number of successful transmissions between  and  is ; therefore,

where the last equation in \eqref{eq:Qtott1} holds because .
\\
From the dynamics of queues we get

Combining \eqref{eq:Qtott1} and \eqref{eq:Qtotandt}, the total number of successful transmissions from time  to  in the second case is at least

\begin{proof}[Detailed derivation of \eqref{eq:QTkrec} and \eqref{eq:qt}  in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:delay}]
\\
\textit{Detailed derivation of \eqref{eq:QTkrec}:}
\\
From \eqref{eq:Tk} and the dynamics of queues we obtain

Equation \eqref{eq:QTkeqA} follows from the definition of . 
Inequality \eqref{eq:QTk} is true because of \eqref{eq:Tk} and the fact that  are all positive.
Note that  is independent of  and  for . 
Therefore, taking the expectation on both sides of \eqref{eq:QTk} we get


\textit{Detailed derivation of \eqref{eq:qt}:}
\\
For any time , suppose  (). Using \eqref{eq:QTkrec} and the dynamics of queues we get

equation (a) in \eqref{eq:qtapp} holds because of \eqref{eq:QTkeqA} and the last inequality in \eqref{eq:qtapp} follows from \eqref{eq:QTkbound}.
