\begin{abstract} 
  We examine the relationship between the {\em algebraic
  -calculus}, a fragment of the differential
  -calculus and the \emph{linear-algebraic
  -calculus}, a candidate -calculus for quantum
  computation. Both calculi are algebraic: each one is equipped with
  an additive and a scalar-multiplicative structure, and their set of
  terms is closed under linear combinations. However, the two
  languages were built using different approaches: the former is a
  call-by-name language whereas the latter is call-by-value; the
  former considers algebraic equalities whereas the latter approaches
  them through rewrite rules.

  In this paper, we analyse how these different approaches relate to one
  another. To this end, we propose four canonical languages based
  on each of the possible choices: call-by-name versus call-by-value,
  algebraic equality versus algebraic rewriting. We show that the
  various languages simulate one another.
Due to subtle interaction between beta-reduction and algebraic
  rewriting, to make the languages consistent some additional
  hypotheses such as confluence or normalisation might be required. We carefully devise
  the required properties for each proof, making them general enough
  to be valid for any sub-language satisfying the corresponding
  properties.

\section{Introduction}

Two algebraic versions of the -calculus arise independently in distinct contexts: the algebraic -calculus ()~\cite{VauxMSCS09} and the linear algebraic -calculus ()~\cite{ArrighiDowekRTA08}. 
Both languages are extensions of -calculus where linear combinations of terms are also terms.
The former has been introduced in the context of linear logic as a fragment of the differential -calculus~\cite{EhrhardRegnierTCS03}: the algebraic structure allows to gather in a non deterministic manner different terms, {\em i.e.}\ each term in the linear combination represents one possible execution. The latter has been introduced as a candidate -calculus for quantum computation: in , a linear combination of terms reflects the phenomenon of superposition, {\em i.e.}\ the capability for a quantum system to be in two or more states at the same time.
Our purpose is to study the connections between the two systems.

In both languages, functions which are linear combinations of terms are interpreted pointwise: , where ``'' denotes the scalar multiplication. The two languages differ in the treatment of the arguments. In , 
in order to deal with the algebraic structure, any function is considered as a linear map: , reflecting the fact that any quantum evolution is a linear map. It reflects a call-by-value behaviour in the sense that the argument is evaluated until one has a base term.
Conversely,  has a call-by-name evolution: , without any restriction on . As a consequence, the evolutions are different as illustrated by the following example. In ,  while in , . 

Because they were designed for different purposes, another difference
appears between the two languages: the way the algebraic part of the
calculus is treated. In , the algebraic structure is captured
with a rewrite system, whereas in  terms are considered up to
algebraic equivalence.

The two choices -- call-by-value versus call-by-name and algebraic
equality versus algebraic reduction -- allow one to construct four
possible calculi. We name them \llinred, \llineq, \lalgred, and \lalgeq. See Figure~\ref{tab:linalg} where they
are presented according to their evaluation policy and the
way they take care of the algebraic part of the language.

\subsection*{Plan of the paper.}
In Section~\ref{sec:originals}, we present the original calculi  and .
In Section~\ref{sec:alglam}, we define the set of terms and the rewrite systems we consider in the paper.
In Section~\ref{sec:relation-orig}, we establish the relation between the original setting and the setting used in this paper.
In Section~\ref{sec:consistency}, we discuss the confluence 
of the algebraic rewrite systems. 
Section~\ref{sec:sim} is concerned with the actual simulations. In Section~\ref{sec:redeq} we consider the correspondence between algebraic reduction and algebraic equality whereas in Sections~\ref{subsec:lintoalg} to~\ref{subsec:algtolin-completeness} we consider the distinction call-by-name versus call-by-value. In Section~\ref{subsec:compose}, we show how the simulations can compose to obtain the correspondence between any two of the four languages. 
In Section~\ref{sec:concl} we conclude by providing some paths for future work.
Omitted and sketched proofs are fully developed in the appendix.


\section{The languages}
In this section we present all the languages: the original setting, and our standardised versions of the algebraic calculi.
\subsection{The original setting}\label{sec:originals}
The language \olin\ was first presented in~\cite{ArrighiDowekRTA08} as
summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:olin}. The rewrite system is defined by
structual induction on the left-hand-side. The factorisation and
application rules ask for a particular subterm of the left-hand-side
to {\em not} reduce (conditions (*) and (**)). Because of the
inductive definition, this is indeed well-defined.
These conditions (*) and (**) in particular ensure confluence: we
refer the reader to the original paper~\cite{ArrighiDowekRTA08} for
more details.

To prove the completeness of the simulation we need analogous lemmas.
Their proofs are similar, but we need to account for the changes mentioned
above. 

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:inverse-term-a} For any term , .
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on . \App{inverse-term-a}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:inverse-value-a} For any value , .
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on . \App{inverse-value-a}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:inverse-step-a} For any computation , if 
  then . Also, if 
  then .
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The proof of this lemma is very similar to the one of
  Lemma~\ref{lem:inverse-step}. It follows by induction, involving several
  intermediary results similar to the ones in the proof of
  Lemma~\ref{lem:inverse-step}, where:  is replaced with
   and  with  in the four first equalities; then:
   is replaced with  and  is
  replaced with . In other words:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  The following equalities hold.
      \begin{enumerate}
	\item {}
	\item 
	\item {}
	\item 
      \end{enumerate}
    \item For all terms  and continuations
       and , 
      .
    \item For all  and
      , .
    \item For any continuation  and term
      , if  then .
    \item For any continuation , scalar  and terms , 
      and , the following relations hold.
      \begin{itemize}
	\item 
	\item 
	\item 
      \end{itemize}
    \item For any suspension , if 
      then .
  \end{itemize}
  \App{inverse-step-a}.
\end{proof}

Finally, we can prove the completeness theorem using the previous lemmas.

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:completeness-a}]
  Using Lemma \ref{lem:inverse-step-a} for each step of the reduction,
  we get that . By Lemma
  \ref{lem:inverse-term-a} and Lemma \ref{lem:inverse-value-a}, this
  implies .
\end{proof}


\subsection{The remaining simulations}\label{subsec:compose}

In Figure~\ref{fig:relation}, some arrows are missing, for example from \llinred to \lalgeq. We now show that the already existing arrows ``compose'' well. The first two simulations are  and  and do not require confluence.
\begin{theorem}
  For any term  and variable ,
  if  (respectively ) where  is a value, then  (respectively ).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Given that , by Theorem~\ref{th:sim}, , which by Theorem~\ref{th:redeq} implies .
  Analogously, given that , by Theorem~\ref{th:sim2}, we have
  , which by
  Theorem~\ref{th:redeq2} implies that   .
\end{proof}


The other two simulations are  and
 and they do require confluence.
\begin{theorem}
  For any term  in a confluent fragment of 
  (respectively ) and variable , if  (respectively ) then we have
   with  
  (respectively  with  ).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Given that  and that  is in a confluent fragment, Theorem~\ref{thm:eqred} states that  with . In addition, Theorem~\ref{th:sim} states that .  
  The other result is similar using
  Theorems~\ref{thm:eqred2} and \ref{th:sim2}. 
\end{proof}

Finally, we show that we can also compose with the
inverse translations to give the completeness of the remaining simulations.
This time however, the requirements of confluence are reversed.

\begin{theorem}
  For any term  and variable , if  (respectively )
  then for any fragment  of  (respectively )
  such that , we have  (respectively ) in .\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  If  then by Theorem \ref{thm:completeness}
   which implies . Similarly if 
  then by Theorem \ref{thm:completeness-a}  which
  implies .\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Let  be a confluent fragment of  (respectively ).
  For any term  and variable  such that  (respectively )
  is in , if  (respectively )
  then  with  (respectively 
  with ).\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  If  then by Theorem \ref{thm:eqred}
   with . By Lemma \ref{lem:inverse-step},
  we get 
  with , which by Lemmas \ref{lem:inverse-term}
  and \ref{lem:inverse-value} imply  with
  .\\
  Similarly, if  then by Theorem \ref{thm:eqred2}
   with . By Lemma \ref{lem:inverse-step-a},
  we get 
  with , which by Lemmas \ref{lem:inverse-term-a}
  and \ref{lem:inverse-value-a} imply 
  with .

\section{Discussion and perspectives}\label{sec:concl}

\subsection{Simulating cloning}
As we discussed in the introduction,  is a language whose
original purpose was to emulate quantum superpositions of states with
linear combinations of terms. However, we saw in Example \ref{ex:2}
that we can emulate the ``cloning'' operation
 in
 using a CPS encoding. How does this relate to the no-cloning
theorem \cite{WoottersZurekNATURE82} stating that a quantum state
cannot be duplicated?

Since  is a higher-order
language, a term both represents a quantum operator (i.e. a linear
map) and a state of the system (i.e. a vector in the space of states).
The choice of a call-by-value reduction strategy enforces this
philosophy: an application  is really ,
and there is no reduction under lambda's, making lambda-abstractions
correspond to ``pieces of code'' to be executed only when applied. So
the term  really stands for a piece of code that
would input a base vector  and produce (possibly after some
process) a superposition . But in itself, the lambda-abstraction
is a base vector -- it is not a linear combination. If we were to use
it, say as argument of , it would
actuallly get duplicated.

On the contrary, the term  is the linear
combination of two operators\,: one that inputs  and produces ,
the other one that inputs  and produces . Fed to the same term
, the distributivity of addition
over application would take precedence: the term  behaves as a
linear operator and  is really
.

We can see the same pattern in the term \,:
the argument to the (linear) operator  is a linear
combination of  and , therefore in  the term
 really corresponds to  and not to .  Along the CPS
transformation from  to , recall from
Section~\ref{subsec:algtolin} that the argument  is
transformed into . We are
therefore not anymore in presence of a linear combination, but of
a program that eventually produces a superposition. But this program
is not a superposition: it is a base state that will be fed unchanged
to an operator. In particular, if this operator is duplicating its
argument, the code  will be
duplicated. But instead of duplicating a superposition of terms, we
are really duplicating the description of a program eventually
producing a superposition.


\subsection{Conclusion}
In this paper we have shown the relation between two algebraic
-calculi,  and , via four canonical languages.
These canonical algebraic -calculi account for all the
different choices we can make between call-by-value versus
call-by-name and algebraic reduction versus algebraic equality. We
showed how each language can simulate the other, by taking care of
marking where confluence was used.

This study opens the door to other questions.  The calculus 
admits finiteness spaces as a model
\cite{EhrhardMSCS05,EhrhardLICS10}. What is the structure of the model
of the linear algebraic -calculus induced by the
continuation-passing style translation in finiteness spaces? The
algebraic lambda-calculus can be equipped with a differential
operator.  What is the corresponding operator in call-by-value through
the translation?  The linear-algebraic lambda-calculus can encode
quantum programs \cite{ArrighiDiazcaroValiron13}. Can this translation
help elucidate the relation between quantum computing and finiteness
spaces?

We now have the tools to prove the Lemma~\ref{lem:inverse-step}.

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:inverse-step}]
  By induction on the reduction rule, using Lemmas \ref{lem:substitution-lemma},
  \ref{lem:continuation-substitution}, \ref{lem:continuation-step},
  \ref{lem:continuation-linearity} and \ref{lem:suspension-step} where
  necessary.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Case . There are several sub-cases.
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Case . Then 
	  
	  is equal to
	  
	  
	  .

	\item Case . Then we have that
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  .

	\item Case . Then
	  
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-substitution}, is equal to
	  

	\item Case . Then  is a
	  base term, and hence ,
	  so
	  
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-step}, \toblinred-reduces to
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:substitution-lemma}, is equal to
	  
	  .
      \end{itemize}
    \item Case . Since  and  are base terms, the only term that
      can match the rules is . There are three sub-cases. 
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Case . Then 
	  
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-linearity}, \stolinred-reduces to
	  
	  .
	\item Case . Then 
	  ,
	  
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-linearity}, \stolinred-reduces to
	  
	  .
	\item Case . Then 
	  ,
	  
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-linearity}, \stolinred-reduces to
	  
	  .
      \end{itemize}
    \item Case . Since the rules in  are common to both languages and
      the inverse translation  distributes linearly over
      the computations, the proof for these cases is straightforward. We
      give the following example. Consider .
      Then
      
      ,
      and this \tolinred-reduces to
      
      .

    \item Case . There are 4 sub-cases.

	  by Lemma \ref{lem:suspension-step}, therefore 
	  
	  ,
	  by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-step}, \tolinred-reduces to
	  
	  .

	\item The other three cases are similar to each other. We give the following
	  example. Consider  and .
	  Then by the induction hypothesis ,
	  therefore 
	  
	  
	  
	  .

We now have the tools to prove the Lemma~\ref{lem:inverse-step-a}.

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:inverse-step-a}]
  By induction on the reduction rule, using Lemmas \ref{lem:substitution-lemma-a},
  \ref{lem:continuation-substitution-a}, \ref{lem:continuation-step-a},
  \ref{lem:continuation-linearity-a} and \ref{lem:suspension-step-a}
  where necessary. The rules  and
   are not applicable since arguments in the target language
  are always base terms.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Case . There are several sub-cases.
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Case . Then 
	  
	  which is equal to
	  
	  
	  .

	\item Case . Then
	  
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-substitution-a}, is equal to
	  .

	\item Case . Then ,
	  and
	  
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-step-a}, \tolinred-reduces to
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:substitution-lemma-a}, is equal to
	  
	  .
      \end{itemize}
    \item Case . Since  and  are base terms, the only term that
      can match the rules is . There are three sub-cases. 
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Case . Then 
	  
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-linearity-a}, \stoalgred-reduces to
	  
	  .
	\item Case . Then 
	  ,
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-linearity-a}, \stoalgred-reduces to
	  
	  .
	\item Case . Then 
	  
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-linearity-a}, \stoalgred-reduces to
	  
	  .
      \end{itemize}
    \item Case . Since the rules in  are common to both languages and
      the inverse translation  distributes linearly over
      the computations, the proof for these cases is straightforward. We
      give the following example. Consider .
      Then
      
      
      ,
      which is equal to
      .

    \item Case . There are 4 sub-cases.
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Case  and . Then 
	  by Lemma \ref{lem:suspension-step-a}, therefore 
	  
	  ,
	  which, by Lemma \ref{lem:continuation-step-a}, \toalgred-reduces to
	  
	  .

	\item The other three cases are similar to each other. We give the following
	  example. Consider  and .
	  Then by the induction hypothesis ,
	  therefore 
	  
	  
	  
	  .
	  \qedhere
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
