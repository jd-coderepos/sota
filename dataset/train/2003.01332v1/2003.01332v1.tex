\begin{abstract}
Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling structured data. 
However, most GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types, making them infeasible to represent  heterogeneous structures. 
In this paper, we present the \model\ (\short) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. 
To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering \short\ to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. 
To handle dynamic heterogeneous graphs, we introduce the relative temporal encoding technique into \short, which is able to capture the dynamic structural dependency with arbitrary durations. 
To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm---\sampling---for efficient and scalable training. 
Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed \short\ model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9--21 on various downstream tasks. The dataset and source code of \short\ are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/acbull/pyHGT}.

Heterogeneous and dynamic graphs are important abstractions for modeling relational data for many real-world systems, and modelling such graphs have been a challenging research topics. Recently, researchers have adopted deep learning into graph domain and achieve competitive performance in various graph-based applications. However, most existing GNN assume nodes are within same distribution and in static graphs, and thus cannot be directly adapted to heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT), for modeling web-scale heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. To model heterogeneity, we leverage the meta relation triplet of heterogeneous graph schema to define interaction and transform matrices, so that the model can capture both the common and specific patterns of different relationships using equal or even smaller parameters. To capture temporal information of graphs, we propose to keep a whole graph with edges happening in different time to avoid structure loss, and adopt relative temporal encoding to make the HGT capture dynamic dependency. We further design a heterogeneous graph sampling algorithm with an inductive timestamp assignment algorithm for training large-scale heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We conduct experiments on Open Academic Graphs (OAG), which contains 0.1 billion nodes and 2 billion edges. The results show that our proposed HGT outperform all the state-of-the-art baselines on various downstream tasks.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}


Heterogeneous graphs have been commonly used for abstracting and modeling complex systems, in which objects of different types interact with each other in various ways. 
Some prevalent instances of such systems include academic graphs, Facebook entity graph, LinkedIn economic graph, and broadly the Internet of Things network. 
For example, the  Open Academic Graph (OAG)~\cite{DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangLTDYZGWSLW19} in Figure \ref{fig:schema} contains five types of nodes: papers, authors, institutions, venues (journal, conference, or preprint), and fields, as well as different types of relationships between them.

    \label{fig:schema}
\end{figure} 


Over the past decade, a significant line of research has been explored for mining heterogeneous graphs~\cite{Sun:BOOK2012}. 
One of the classical paradigms is to define and use meta paths to model heterogeneous structures, such as PathSim~\cite{Sun:VLDB11} and metapath2vec~\cite{dong2017metapath2vec}. 
Recently, in view of graph neural networks' (GNNs) success~\cite{gcn, graphsage, gat}, there are several attempts to adopt GNNs to learn with heterogeneous networks~\cite{DBLP:conf/esws/SchlichtkrullKB18,DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangSHSC19,DBLP:conf/www/WangJSWYCY19,gt}. 
However, these works face several issues: 
First, most of them involve the design of meta paths  for each type of heterogeneous graphs, requiring specific domain knowledge; 
Second, they either simply assume that different types of nodes/edges share the same feature and representation space or keep distinct non-sharing weights for either node type or edge type alone, making them insufficient to capture heterogeneous graphs' properties; 
Third, most of them ignore the dynamic nature of every (heterogeneous) graph; 
Finally, their intrinsic design and implementation make them incapable of modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. 


Take OAG for example: First, the nodes and edges in OAG could have different feature distributions, e.g., papers have text features whereas institutions may have features from affiliated scholars, and coauthorships obviously differ from citation links; 
Second, OAG has been consistently evolving, e.g., 1) the volume of publications doubles every 12 years~\cite{dong2017century}, and 2) the KDD conference was more related to database in the 1990s whereas more to machine learning in recent years; 
Finally, OAG contains hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of relationships, leaving existing heterogeneous GNNs not scalable for handling it.  


In light of these limitations and challenges, we propose to study heterogeneous graph neural networks with the goal of maintaining node- and edge-type dependent representations, capturing network dynamics, avoiding customized meta paths, and being scalable to Web-scale graphs. 
In this work, we present the \model\ (\short) architecture to deal with all these issues. 





To handle graph heterogeneity, we introduce the node- and edge-type dependent attention mechanism.
Instead of parameterizing each type of edges, the heterogeneous mutual attention in \short\ is defined by breaking down each edge  based on its meta relation triplet, i.e.,  node type of , edge type of  between  \& , node type of . Figure \ref{fig:schema} illustrates the meta relations of heterogeneous academic graphs. 
In specific, we use these meta relations to parameterize the weight matrices for calculating attention over each edge.
As a result, nodes and edges of different types are allowed to maintain their specific representation spaces.
Meanwhile, connected nodes in different types can still interact, pass, and aggregate messages without being restricted by their distribution gaps.
Due to the nature of its architecture, \short\ can incorporate information from high-order neighbors of different types through message passing across layers, which can be regarded as ``soft'' meta paths. 
That said, even if \short\ take only its one-hop edges as input without manually designing meta paths, the proposed attention mechanism can automatically and implicitly learn and extract ``meta paths'' that are important for different downstream tasks. 


To handle graph dynamics, we enhance \short\ by proposing the relative temporal encoding (RTE) strategy. 
Instead of slicing the input graph into different timestamps, we propose to maintain all the edges happening in different times as a whole, and design the RTE strategy to model structural temporal dependencies with any duration length, and even with unseen and future timestamps. 
By end-to-end training, RTE enables \short\ to automatically learn the temporal dependency and evolution of heterogeneous graphs. 


To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the first heterogeneous sub-graph sampling algorithm---\sampling---for mini-batch GNN training. 
Its main idea is to sample heterogeneous sub-graphs in which different types of nodes are with similar proportions, since the direct usage of existing (homogeneous) GNN sampling methods, such as GraphSage~\cite{graphsage}, FastGCN~\cite{fastgcn}, and LADIES~\cite{ladies}, results in highly imbalanced ones regarding to both node and edge types. 
In addition, it is also designed to keep the sampled sub-graphs dense for minimizing the loss of information. 
With \sampling, all the GNN models, including our proposed \short, can train and infer on arbitrary-size heterogeneous graphs. 


We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed \model\ on the Web-scale Open Academic Graph comprised of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges spanning from 1900 to 2019, making this the largest-scale
and longest-spanning representation learning yet performed on heterogeneous graphs. 
Additionally, we also examine it on domain-specific graphs: the computer science and medicine academic graphs. 
Experimental results suggest that \short\ can significantly improve various downstream tasks over state-of-the-art GNNs as well as dedicated heterogeneous models by 9--21. 
We further conduct case studies to show the proposed method can indeed  automatically capture the importance of implicit meta paths for different tasks. 



 








































\begin{comment}
\yd{To Ziniu:  1 how it differs from and better than HAN/RGCN; 2; why better than meta-path based method; 3 why three matrices are better than one}
\zn{(1) For heterogeneity, they keep different parameters for each <node, edge, node> pair. However, the number of different relation can vary greatly. For some rare relation, it's not sufficient to update the parameters. On the other hand, there exist some similarity between different relationship. For example, for the first-author link and last-author link obviously share some common pattern. Therefore, is both necessary and possible to decompose the pairwise weights and have parameter sharing. In view of this, we propose to model the interaction by three matrix, source node weight, edge weight, target node weight. The edge weight is relatively smaller compare to node weights. Thus, we can capture both the common and specific patterns of different relationships, using less or equal memory consumption; Also, using three matrices to define interaction and message passing is more natural with heterogeneous graph structure. We use target node's corresponding type matrix to calculate key, use source node's type matrix to calculate query, and edge type matrix serves as an interaction component. Such model better fits the graph structure. For time, these two methods don't capture temporal dependency. 
(2) GNN approaches by its natural can incorporate high-order neighbor information. As long as we can keep the node and edge property, the meta-path information has already been included in through the message passing, and the attention mechanism can even automatically learn the important path for each tasks, without the requirement to explicit defining it.
(3) [1] Weight sharing. Through decomposition, edge weight is smaller than node weight, and thus even some rare edge can be updated fast and robustly. [2] The original transformer already differentiate the Key matrix, Query matrix and Value matrix. Obviously we cannot keep a brand new matrix for each triplet pair. Such decomposition can also been seen as a trade-off between performance and memory.

Many real-world systems can be modelled as interconnected graphs with multiple node and link types. For example, in a healthcare graph, nodes can be categorized into patients, doctors, diseases, medicines, hospitals, etc. Such kind of graph, known as Heterogeneous Graph has attracted many research interests in recent years. 


Recently, researchers have adopted deep learning into graph domain and proposed various Graph Neural Network architectures (GNNs)~\cite{gcn, graphsage, DBLP:conf/iclr/VelickovicCCRLB18}. to achieve competitive performance in various graph-based applications, such as semi-supervised node classification~\cite{gcn}, recommendation systems~\cite{DBLP:conf/kdd/YingHCEHL18} and knowledge graphs~\cite{DBLP:conf/esws/SchlichtkrullKB18}.
Seeing the success of GNN for modelling graph in various domains, one natural idea is that whether we can adopt it to model heterogeneous graphs. However, most existing GNN base on the assumption that nodes in the graphs are within same distribution, so that all node pairs can interact with same procedure, while the key property of heterogeneous graphs is that different type of nodes can have totally different semantic meaning, and thus the way to represent them should be different. For example, to represent a patient, we may focus on his/her personal health profile, which is normally a table data, while text description can be significant to represent a medicine. These representations are always not in same space, not necessarily have same dimension, and not generated from same model. In addition, different type of links also have different meaning. For example, the doctor-patient link is obviously different from medicine-disease link. The different semantic meaning of node type and link type hinder the direct usage of GNN into heterogeneous graphs. Although there are several works try to use GNN to model heterogeneous graphs, they simply assume that different nodes have same feature space and within same distribution, which doesn't fully utilize the rich semantic of the heterogeneity. 

Moreover, real-world graphs can be dynamic, with new nodes and edges adding or removing. Considering the dynamic of graphs, even a same node will have different semantic meaning in different timestamp. For example, WWW held in 1994 concentrates on the Internet architecture and protocol, while the same conference in 2019 also focus on other interesting topics as graph mining and social science. Therefore, to accurately model real-world graphs, the designed GNNs should also have the capacity to maintain temporal information and dependency.


In view of the above demands, a desired GNN model should consider both heterogeneity and dynamic of real-world graphs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN architecture, Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT), for modeling web-scale heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. The basic architecture is built based on adopting the transformer into heterogeneous graph, where two connected nodes can interact and propagate information with carefully decoupled weights, so that the model can learn to capture graph patterns for both heterogeneity and dynamic.

For graph heterogeneity, We use the meta relation triplet of graph schema to define interaction and transform matrices, so that the model can capture both the common and specific patterns of different relationships using equal or even smaller parameters. In this way, the nodes in different types are allowed to maintain in their specific representation distribution, while connected nodes in different types can still interact and transform messages without being restricted by distribution gap.


For the graph dynamic without losing structure information, we first define a dynamic timestamp schema, under which the graph reserves all the edges happening in different times. Then we propose a relative temporal encoding to incorporate temporal information into HGT using limited computational resources. By end-to-end training, the model can automatically learn the temporal dependency and differences, 



In addition to the model architecture, training GNN for large-scale graph is also a significant challenge. The vanilla GCN has to calculate all the node representation in the graph, which is infeasible for web-scale graph data. To alleviate with it, researchers have proposed different sampling methods to conduct mini-batch training~\cite{graphsage,fastgcn,DBLP:conf/icml/ChenZS18,ladies}. However, all these sampling methods are designed for homogeneous graphs, and there has not been any work to conduct large-scale training for heterogeneous graphs. We therefore design a heterogeneous layer-dependent sub-graph sampling algorithm, with which the model can train on arbitrary large graphs and can achieve good performance.

\section{Preliminaries and Related Work}\label{sec:problem} 
In this section, we introduce the basic definition of heterogeneous graphs with network dynamics and review the recent development on graph neural networks (GNNs) and their heterogeneous variants. 
We also highlight the difference between \short \ and existing attempts on heterogeneous graph neural networks.


\subsection{Heterogeneous Graph Mining}
Heterogeneous graphs~\cite{Sun:BOOK2012} (a.k.a., heterogeneous information networks) are an important abstraction for modeling relational data for many real-world complex systems. Formally, it is defined as:
\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{defn}{\textbf{Heterogeneous Graph:}}
A heterogeneous graph is defined as a directed graph  where each node  and each edge  are associated with their type mapping functions  and , respectively. 
\end{defn}

\vpara{Meta Relation.}For an edge  linked from source node  to target node , its {meta relation} is denoted as . Naturally,  represents the inverse of . The classical meta path paradigm~\cite{Sun:VLDB11,DBLP:conf/kdd/SunNHYYY12, Sun:BOOK2012} is defined as a sequence of such meta relation.

Notice that, to better model real-world heterogeneous networks, we assume that there may exist multiple types of relations between different types of nodes. 
For example, in OAG there are different types of relations between the \textit{author} and \textit{paper} nodes by considering the authorship order, i.e., ``the first author of'', ``the second author of'', and so on.


\vpara{Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph.}To model the dynamic nature of real-world (heterogeneous) graphs, we assign an edge   a timestamp , when node  connects to node  at . 
If  appears for the first time,  is also assigned to . 
 can be associated with multiple timestamps if it builds connections over time. 

In other words, we assume that the timestamp of an edge is unchanged, denoting the time it is created. For example, when a paper published on a conference at time ,  will be assigned to the edge between the paper and conference nodes. 
On the contrary, different timestamps can be assigned to a node accordingly. 
For example, the \textit{conference} node ``WWW'' can be assigned any year.  means that we are considering the first edition of WWW, which focuses more on internet protocol and Web infrastructure, while  means the upcoming WWW, which expands its research topics to social analysis, ubiquitous computing, search \& IR, privacy and society, etc. 

There have been significant lines of research on mining heterogenous graphs, such as node classification, clustering, ranking and representation learning~\cite{Sun:BOOK2012,Sun:VLDB11,DBLP:conf/kdd/SunNHYYY12,dong2017metapath2vec}, while the dynamic perspective of HGs has not been extensively explored and studied. 



\subsection{Graph Neural Networks}
Recent years have witnessed the success of graph neural networks for relational data~\cite{gcn,gat,graphsage}. 
Generally, a GNN can be regarded as using the input graph structure as the computation graph for message passing~\cite{DBLP:conf/icml/GilmerSRVD17}, during which the local neighborhood information is aggregated to get a more contextual representation. Formally, it has the following form:
\begin{defn}{\textbf{General GNN Framework:}}
Suppose  is the node representation of node  at the -th GNN layer, the update procedure from the --th layer to the -th layer is:

where  denotes all the source nodes of node  and   denotes all the edges from node  to . 
\end{defn}

The most important GNN operators are Extract() and Aggregate(). 
Extract() represents the neighbor information extractor. 
It extract useful information from source node's representation , with the target node's representation  and the edge  between the two nodes as query. 
Aggregate() gather the neighborhood information of souce nodes via some aggregation operators, such as \textit{mean, sum,} and \textit{max}, while more sophisticated pooling and normalization functions can be also designed.

Various (homogeneous) GNN architectures have been proposed following this framework.  
Kipf \textit{et al.}~\cite{gcn} propose graph convolutional network (GCN), which averages the one-hop neighbor of each node in the graph, followed by a linear projection and non-linear activation operations. 
Hamilton  \textit{et al.} propose GraphSAGE that generalizes GCN's aggregation operation from \textit{average} to \textit{sum, max} and a \textit{RNN unit}. 
Velickovi  \textit{et al.} propose graph attention network (GAT)~\cite{gat} by introducing the attention mechanism into GNNs, which allows GAT to assign different importance to nodes within the same neighborhood. 



\subsection{Heterogeneous GNNs}
Recently, studies have attempted to extend GNNs for modeling heterogeneous graphs. 
Schlichtkrull \textit{et al.}~\cite{DBLP:conf/esws/SchlichtkrullKB18} propose the relational graph convolutional networks (RGCN) to model knowledge graphs. 
RGCN keeps a distinct linear projection weight for each edge type. 
Zhang \textit{et al.}~\cite{DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangSHSC19} present the heterogeneous graph neural networks (HetGNN) that adopts different RNNs for different node types to integrate multi-modal features. 
Wang \textit{et al.}~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/WangJSWYCY19} extend graph attention networks by maintaining different weights for different meta-path-defined edges. They also use high-level semantic attention to differentiate and aggregate information from different meta paths.

Though these methods have shown to be empirically better than the vanilla GCN and GAT models, they have not fully utilized the heterogeneous graphs' properties. All of them use either node type or edge type alone to determine GNN weight matrices. 
However, the node or edge counts of different types can vary greatly. 
For relations that don't have sufficient occurrences, it's hard to learn accurate relation-specific weights. To address this, we propose to consider parameter sharing for a better generalization. 
Given an edge   with its meta relation as , if we use three interaction matrices to model the three corresponding elements , and  in the meta relation, then the majority of weights could be shared. 
For example, in ``the first author of'' and ``the second author of'' relationships, their source and target node types are both \textit{author} to \textit{paper}, respectively. 
In other words, the knowledge about \textit{author} and \textit{paper} learned from one relation could be quickly transferred and adapted to the other one. 
Therefore, we integrate this idea with the powerful Transformer-like attention architecture, and propose \model. 

To summarize, the key differences between \short\ and existing attempts include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Instead of attending on node or edge type alone, we use the meta relation  to decompose the interaction and transform matrices, enabling \short\ to capture both the common and specific patterns of different relationships using equal or even fewer parameters.
    \item Different from most of the existing works that are based on customized meta paths, we rely on the nature of the neural architecture to incorporate high-order heterogeneous neighbor information, which automatically learns the importance of implicit meta paths.  
    \item Most previous works don't take the dynamic nature of (heterogeneous) graphs into consideration, while we propose the relative temporal encoding technique to incorporate temporal information by using limited computational resources.
    \item None of the existing heterogeneous GNNs are designed for and experimented with Web-scale graphs, we therefore propose the heterogeneous Mini-Batch graph sampling algorithm designed for Web-scale graph training, enabling experiments on the billion-scale Open Academic Graph.
\end{enumerate}

    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure*} 







In this section, we present the \model\ (\short). Its  idea is to use the \textbf{meta relations} of heterogeneous graphs to parameterize weight matrices for the heterogeneous mutual attention, message passing, and propagation steps. 
To further incorporate network dynamics, we introduce a relative temporal encoding mechanism into the model.




\subsection{Overall \short\ Architecture}

Figure~\ref{fig:my_label} shows the overall architecture of \model. Given a sampled heterogeneous sub-graph (Cf. Section \ref{sec:train}), \short\ extracts all linked node pairs, where target node  is linked by source node  via edge . The goal of \short\ is to aggregate information from source nodes to get a contextualized representation for target node . Such process can be decomposed into three components: \textit{Heterogeneous Mutual Attention}, \textit{Heterogeneous Message Passing} and \textit{Target-Specific Aggregation}. 

We denote the output of the -th \short\ layer as , which is also the input of the +-th layer. 
By stacking  layers, we can get the node representations of the whole graph , which can be used for end-to-end training or fed into downstream tasks.  

\hide{
\subsection{Relative Temporal Encoding}

To incorporate temporal information into the model, one naive way is to construct a separate graph for each time slot. However, such a procedure may lose a large portion of structural information across different time slots. 
Meanwhile, the representation of a node at time  might rely on edges that happened at other time slots. 
Therefore, a proper way to model dynamic graphs is to maintain all the edges happening at different times and allow nodes and edges with different timestamps to interact with each other.

In light of this, we present the Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE) mechanism to model the dynamic dependencies in heterogeneous graphs. 
RTE is inspired by Transformer's positional encoding method~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/VaswaniSPUJGKP17, DBLP:conf/naacl/ShawUV18}, which has been shown successful to capture the sequential dependency of words in long texts. 

Given a source node  and a target node , along with their corresponding timestamps  and , we denote the relative time gap  as an index to get a relative temporal encoding . Noted that the training dataset will not cover all possible time gaps, and thus   should be capable of generalizing to unseen time. We thus adopt a fixed set of sinusoid functions as basis, with a tunable linear projection T-Linear\footnote{For simplicity, we denote a linear projection L  as a function to conduct linear transformation to vector  as: L, where matrix  and bias .  and  are learnable parameters for L.} as :

Finally, the temporal encoding relative to the target node  is added to the source node ' representation as follows:

In this way, the temporal augmented representation  will capture the relative temporal information of source node  and target node . The whole procedure is illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (1). 


}

\subsection{Heterogeneous Mutual Attention}

The first step is to calculate the mutual attention between source node  and target node . We first give a brief introduction to the general attention-based GNNs as follows: 

where there are three basic operators: \textbf{Attention}, which estimates the importance of each source node; \textbf{Message}, which extracts the message by using only the source node ; and \textbf{Aggregate}, which aggregates the neighborhood message by the attention weight. 



For example, the Graph Attention Network (GAT)~\cite{gat} adopts an additive mechanism as \textbf{Attention}, uses the same weight for calculating \textbf{Message}, and leverages the simple average followed by a nonlinear activation for the \textbf{Aggregate} step. 
Formally, GAT has

Though GAT is effective to give high attention values to important nodes, it assumes that  and  have the same feature distributions by using one weight matrix . 
Such an assumption, as we've discussed in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, 
is usually incorrect for heterogeneous graphs, where each type of nodes can have its own feature distribution. 


In view of this limitation, we design the \textbf{Heterogeneous Mutual Attention} mechanism. 
Given a target node , and all its neighbors , which might belong to different distributions, we want to calculate their mutual attention grounded by their \textbf{meta relations}, i.e., the  triplets. 

Inspired by the architecture design of Transformer~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/VaswaniSPUJGKP17}, we  map target node  into a Query vector, and source node  into a Key vector, and calculate their dot product as attention. The key difference is that the vanilla Transformer uses a single set of projections for all words, while in our case each meta relation should have a distinct set of projection weights. To maximize parameter sharing while still maintaining the specific characteristics of different relations, we propose to parameterize the weight matrices of the interaction operators into a source node projection, an edge projection, and a target node projection. Specifically, we calculate the -head {attention} for each edge  (See Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (1)) by:

First, for the -th attention head , we project the -type source node  into the -th \textit{Key} vector  with a linear projection K-Linear, where  is the number of attention heads and  is the vector dimension per head. 
Note that K-Linear is indexed by the source node 's type , meaning that each type of nodes has a unique linear projection to maximally model the distribution differences. 
Similarly, we also project the target node  with a linear projection Q-Linear into the th Query vector. 



Next, we need to calculate the similarity between the Query vector  and Key vector . 
One unique characteristic of heterogeneous graphs is that there may exist different edge types (relations) between a node type pair, e.g.,  and . 
Therefore, unlike the vanilla Transformer that directly calculates the dot product between the Query and Key vectors, we keep a distinct edge-based matrix  for each edge type . In doing so, the model can capture different semantic relations even between the same node type pairs. 
Moreover, since not all the relationships contribute equally to the target nodes, 
we add a prior tensor  to denote the general significance of each meta relation triplet, serving as an adaptive scaling to the attention. 

Finally, we concatenate  attention heads together to get the attention vector for each node pair. 
Then, for each target node , we gather all attention vectors from its neighbors  and conduct softmax, making it fulfill .



\subsection{Heterogeneous Message Passing}
Parallel to the calculation of mutual attention, we pass information from source nodes to target nodes (See Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (2)). 
Similar to the attention process, we would like to incorporate the meta relations of edges into the message passing process to alleviate the distribution differences of nodes and edges of different types. For a pair of nodes , we calculate its multi-head \textbf{Message} by:

To get the -th message head , we first project the -type source node  into the -th message vector with a linear projection M-Linear. 
It is then followed by a matrix  for incorporating the edge dependency. 
The final step is to concat all  message heads to get the   for each node pair.


\subsection{Target-Specific Aggregation}
With the heterogeneous multi-head attention and message calculated, we need to aggregate them from the source nodes to the target node (See Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (3)). 
Note that the softmax procedure in Eq. \ref{eq:hgt-att} has made the sum of each target node 's attention vectors to one, we can thus simply use the attention vector as the weight to average the corresponding messages from the source nodes and get the updated vector  as:

This aggregates information to the target node  from all its neighbors (source nodes) of different feature distributions. 

The final step is to map target node 's vector back to its type-specific distribution, indexed by its node type . 
To do so, we apply a linear projection A-Linear to the updated vector , followed by residual connection~\cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/HeZRS16} as:

In this way, we get the -th \short\ layer's output  for the target node . 
Due to the ``small-world'' property of real-world graphs, stacking the \short\ blocks for  layers ( being a small value) can enable each node reaching  a large proportion of nodes---with different types and relations---in the full graph. 
That is, \short\ generates a highly contextualized representation  for each node, which can be fed into any models to conduct downstream heterogeneous network tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. 

Through the whole model architecture, we highly rely on using the \textbf{meta relation}------to parameterize the weight matrices separately. 
This can be interpreted as a trade-off between the model capacity and efficiency. Compared with the vanilla Transformer, our model distinguishes the operators for different relations and thus is more capable to handle the distribution differences in heterogeneous graphs. 
Compared with existing models that keep a distinct matrix for each meta relation as a whole, \short's triplet parameterization can better leverage the heterogeneous graph schema to achieve parameter sharing. 
On one hand, relations with few occurrences can benefit from such parameter sharing for fast adaptation and generalization. 
On the other hand, different relationships' operators can still maintain their specific characteristics by using a much smaller parameter set.

\subsection{Relative Temporal Encoding}
By far, we present \short---a graph neural network for modeling heterogeneous graphs. 
Next, we introduce the Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE) technique for \short\ to handle graph dynamic. 


The traditional way to incorporate temporal information is to construct a separate graph for each time slot. 
However, such a procedure may lose a large portion of structural dependencies across different time slots. 
Meanwhile, the representation of a node at time  might rely on edges that happen at other time slots. 
Therefore, a proper way to model dynamic graphs is to maintain all the edges happening at different times and allow nodes and edges with different timestamps to interact with each other.

In light of this, we propose the Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE) mechanism to model the dynamic dependencies in heterogeneous graphs. 
RTE is inspired by Transformer's positional encoding method~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/VaswaniSPUJGKP17, DBLP:conf/naacl/ShawUV18}, which has been shown successful to capture the sequential dependencies of words in long texts. 

Specifically, given a source node  and a target node , along with their corresponding timestamps  and , we denote the relative time gap  as an index to get a relative temporal encoding . 
Noted that the training dataset will not cover all possible time gaps, and thus   should be capable of generalizing to unseen times and time gaps. 
Therefore, we adopt a fixed set of sinusoid functions as basis, with a tunable linear projection T-Linear\footnote{For simplicity, we denote a linear projection L  as a function to conduct linear transformation to vector  as: L, where matrix  and bias .  and  are learnable parameters for L.} as :

Finally, the temporal encoding relative to the target node  is added to the source node ' representation as follows:

In this way, the temporal augmented representation  will capture the relative temporal information of source node  and target node . The RTE procedure is illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:rte}.

\end{figure*} 





In this section, we present the \model\ (\short) architecture for modeling heterogeneous graphs with network dynamics. Its core idea is to use \textbf{meta relation} to parametrize weight matrices for the heterogeneous mutual attention, message passing, and propagation. 
To incorporate network dynamics, we introduce a relative temporal encoding mechanism into the model. 


\subsection{Overall \short\ Architecture}

Figure~\ref{fig:my_label} shows the overall architecture of \model. Given a sampled heterogeneous graph (Cf. Section \ref{sec:train}), \short\ extracts all linked node pairs, where target node  is linked by source node  via edge . The goal of \short\ is to aggregates information from  to get a contextualized representation for target node . Such process can be decomposed into four components: \textit{Relative Temporal Encoding, Heterogeneous Mutual Attention}, \textit{Heterogeneous Message Passing} and \textit{Target-Specific Aggregation}. 

We denote the output of the -th \short\ layer is , which is also the input of the +-th layer. 
By stacking  layers, we can get the node representations of the whole graph , which can be used for end-to-end training or fed into downstream tasks.  

\subsection{Relative Temporal Encoding}

To incorporate temporal information into the model, one naive way is to construct a separate graph for each time slot. However, such a procedure may lose a large portion of structural information across different time slots. 
Meanwhile, the representation of a node at time  might rely on edges that happened at other time slots. 
Therefore, a proper way to model dynamic graphs is to maintain all the edges happening at different times and allow nodes and edges with different timestamps to interact with each other.

In light of this, we present the Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE) mechanism to model the dynamic dependencies in heterogeneous graphs. 
RTE is inspired by Transformer's positional encoding method~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/VaswaniSPUJGKP17, DBLP:conf/naacl/ShawUV18}, which has been shown successful to capture the sequential dependency of words in long texts. 

Given a source node  and a target node , along with their corresponding timestamps  and , we denote the relative time gap  as an index to get a relative temporal encoding . Noted that the training dataset will not cover all possible time gaps, and thus   should be capable of generalizing to unseen time. We thus adopt a fixed set of sinusoid functions as basis, with a tunable linear projection T-Linear\footnote{For simplicity, we denote a linear projection L  as a function to conduct linear transformation to vector  as: L, where matrix  and bias .  and  are learnable parameters for L.} as :

Finally, the temporal encoding relative to the target node  is added to the source node ' representation as follows:

In this way, the temporal augmented representation  will capture the relative temporal information of source node  and target node . The whole procedure is illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (1). 



\subsection{Heterogeneous Mutual Attention}

The second step is to calculate mutual attention between source node  and target node . We first give a brief introduction to the general attention-based GNNs as follow: 

Compared to the general GNN Framework, it implements the neighbor information extractor \textbf{Extract} by two major components: \textbf{Attention}, which estimates the importance of each source node, and \textbf{Message}, which extracts the message by using only the source node .

For example, the Graph Attention Network (GAT)~\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/VelickovicCCRLB18} adopts an additive mechanism as \textbf{Attention}, uses the same weight for calculating \textbf{Message}, and leverages the simple average followed by a nonlinear activation for the \textbf{Aggregate} step. 
Formally, GAT has

Though GAT is effective to give high attention values to important nodes, it assumes that  and  have the same feature distributions by using one weight matrix . 
Such an assumption, as we've discussed in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, 
is usually incorrect for heterogeneous graphs, where each type of nodes can have its own feature distribution. 


In view of this limitation, we design a \textbf{Heterogeneous Mutual Attention} mechanism. 
Given a target node , and all its neighbors , which might belong to different distributions, we want to calculate their mutual attention grounded by \textbf{meta relation}, i.e., the  triplet. 

Inspired by the architecture design of Transformer, we also map target node  into a Query vector, and source node  into a Key vector, and calculate their dot product as attention. The key difference is that the vanilla Transformer uses a single set of projection for all words, while in our case each meta relation should have a distinct set of projection weights. To maximize parameter sharing while still maintaining the specific characteristics of different relations, we propose to parametrize the weight matrices of interaction operator into a source node projection, an edge projection and a target node projection. Specifically, we calculate the -head {Attention} from each source node  to  (See Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (2)) by:

First, for the -th attention head , we project the source node  (node type ) into the -th \textit{Key} vector  with a linear projection K-Linear , where  is the number of attention heads and  is the vector dimension per head. 
Note that K-Linear is indexed by the source node 's type , meaning that each type of nodes has a unique linear projection to maximally model the distribution differences. 
Similarly, we also project the target node  with a linear projection Q-Linear into the th Query vector. 



Next, we need to calculate the similarity between the Query vector  and Key vector . 
One unique characteristic of heterogeneous graphs is that there may have different edge types (relations) between a node type pair (e.g.,  and ). 
Therefore, unlike the vanilla Transformer that directly calculates the dot product between the Query and Key vectors, we keep a distinct edge-based matrix  for each edge type . In doing so, the model can capture different semantic relations even between the same node type pairs. 
Moreover, since not all the relationships contribute equally to the target nodes, 
we add a prior tensor  to denote the general significance of each meta relation triplet, serving as an adaptive scaling to the attention. 

Finally, we concatenate  attention heads together to get the attention vector for each node pair. 
Then, for each target node , we gather all attention vectors from its neighbors  and conduct softmax, making it fulfill .



\subsection{Heterogeneous Message Passing}
Parallel to the calculation of mutual attention, we pass information from source nodes to target nodes (See Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (3)). 
Similar to the attention process, we would like to incorporate meta relation into the message passing process to alleviate the distribution differences of nodes and edges of different types. For a pair of nodes , we calculate its multi-head \textbf{Message} by:

To get the -th message head , we first project the source node  of the node type  into the -th message vector with a linear projection M-Linear. 
It is then followed by a matrix  for incorporating the edge dependency. 
The final step is to concat all  message heads to get the   for each node pair.


\subsection{Target-Specific Aggregation}
With the heterogeneous multi-head attention and message calculated, we need to aggregate them from the source nodes to the target node (See Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (4)). 
Note that the softmax procedure in Eq. \ref{eq:hgt-att} has made the sum of each target node 's attention vectors to one, we can thus simply use the attention vector as weight to average the corresponding messages from the source nodes and get the updated vector  as:


Eq. \ref{eq:agg} aggregates information to the target node  from all its neighbors (source nodes) of different feature distributions. 

The final step is to map 's vector back to its type-specific distribution, indexed by its node type . 
To do so, we apply a linear projection A-Linear to the updated vector , followed by a non-linear activation (Eq. \ref{eq:output}). Specifically, we have: 




In this way, we get the -th \short\ layer's output  for the target node . 
Due to the ``small-world'' property of real-world graphs, stacking the \short\ blocks for multiple layers can enable each node reaching to a large proportion of nodes---with different types and relations---in the full graph. 
In other words, \short\ generates a highly contextualized representation  for each node, which can be fed into any models to conduct downstream heterogeneous network tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. 

Through the whole model architecture, we highly rely on using the \textbf{meta relation}------to parametrize weight matrices. This can be interpreted as a tradeoff between model capacity and efficiency. Compared with the vanilla Transformer, our model distinguishes the operators for different relations and thus is more capable to handle the distribution differences in heterogeneous graphs. 
Compared with existing models that keep a distinct matrix for each relation, \short's triple parameterization can better leverage the heterogeneous graph schema to achieve parameter sharing. On one hand, relations with few occurrences can benefit from such parameter sharing for fast adaptation and generalization. One the other hand, different relationships' operators can still maintain their specific characteristics, using much smaller parameters.

\section{Web-scale \short\ Training}\label{sec:train}


 \begin{figure*}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{picture/sample.png}
    \caption{\sampling\ with Inductive Timestamp Assignment.}
    \label{fig:sample}
\end{figure*} 


In this section, we present \short's strategies for training Web-scale heterogeneous graphs with dynamic information, including an efficient Heterogeneous Mini-Batch Graph Sampling algorithm---\sampling---and an inductive timestamp assignment method. 

\subsection{\sampling}

The full-batch GNN~\cite{gcn} training requires the calculation of all node representations per layer, 
making it not scalable for Web-scale graphs. 
To address this issue, different sampling-based methods~\cite{graphsage,fastgcn,DBLP:conf/icml/ChenZS18,ladies} have been proposed to train GNNs on a subset of nodes. 
However, directly using them for heterogeneous graphs is prone to get sub-graphs that are extremely imbalanced regarding different node types, due to that the degree distribution and the total number of nodes for each type can vary dramatically. 

To address this issue, we propose an efficient Heterogeneous Mini-Batch Graph Sampling algorithm---\sampling---to enable both \short\ and traditional GNNs to handle Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. 
\sampling\ is able to 1) keep a similar number of nodes and edges for each type and 2) keep the sampled sub-graph dense to minimize the information loss and reduce the sample variance. 


Algorithm \ref{alg:sample} outlines the \sampling\ algorithm. 
Its basic idea is to keep a separate node budget  for each node type  and to sample an equal number of nodes per type with an importance sampling strategy to reduce variance. 
Given node  already sampled, we add all its direct neighbors into the corresponding budget with Algorithm~\ref{alg:budget}, and add 's normalized degree to these neighbors in line~\ref{line:update}, which will then be used to calculate the sampling probability. 
Such normalization is equivalent to accumulate the random walk probability of each sampled node to its neighborhood, avoiding the sampling being dominated by high-degree nodes. 
Intuitively, the higher such value is, the more a candidate node is correlated with the currently sampled nodes, and thus should be given a higher probability to be sampled.

After the budget is updated, we then calculate the sampling probability in Algorithm~\ref{alg:sample} line~\ref{line:prob}, where we calculate the square of the cumulative normalized degree of each node  in each budget. 
As proved in~\cite{ladies}, using such sampling probability can reduce the sampling variance. Then, we sample  nodes in  type  by using the calculated probability, add them into the output node set, update its neighborhood to the budget, and remove it out of the budget in lines~\ref{line:samp}--\ref{line:end}. 
Repeating such procedure for  times, we get a sampled sub-graph with  depth from the initial nodes. Finally, we reconstruct the adjacency matrix among the sampled nodes. 
By using the above algorithm, the sampled sub-graph contains a similar number of nodes per  type (based on the separate node budget), and is sufficiently dense to reduce the sampling variance (based on the normalized degree and importance sampling), making it suitable for training GNNs on Web-scale heterogeneous graphs.

            \ENDIF
        \ENDFOR  
    \ENDFOR
\RETURN Updated Budget 
\end{algorithmic} 
\end{algorithm}



 

\subsection{ Inductive Timestamp Assignment}

Till now we have assumed that each node  is assigned with a timestamp . However, in real-world heterogeneous graphs, many nodes are not associated with a fixed time. Therefore, we need to assign different timestamps to it. We denote these nodes as {plain nodes}. For example, the WWW conference is held in both 1974 and 2019, and the WWW node in these two years has dramatically different research topics. Consequently, we need to decide which timestamp(s) to attach to the WWW node. 

There also exist {event nodes} in heterogeneous graphs that have an explicit timestamp associated with them. 
For example, the paper node should be associated with its publication behavior and therefore attached to its publication date. 

We propose an inductive timestamp assignment algorithm to assign plain nodes timestamps based on event nodes that they are linked with. 
The algorithm is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:budget} line~\ref{line:time}. 
The  idea is that plan nodes inherit the timestamps from event nodes. 
We examine whether the candidate source node is an event node. If yes, like a paper published at a specific year, we keep its timestamp for capturing temporal dependency. 
If no, like a conference that can be associated with any timestamp, we inductively assign the associated node's timestamp, such as the published year of its paper, to this plain node. In this way, we can adaptively assign timestamps during the sub-graph sampling procedure.




















































































\hide{

In this section, we discuss how we train the proposed relational graph transformer for web-scale graphs. We firstly describe an efficient sub-graph sampling mechanism, which is designed explicitly for large-scale heterogeneous graph, and can get an informative subgraph for calculating accurate representation. Then we describe how we assign timestamps inductively for keeping temporal information.

\subsection{Graph Sampling for Heterogeneous Graph}

one major challenge of training deep GNN for large-scale graphs remains a big challenge. Original full-batch GNN~\cite{gcn} training requires calculating the representation of all the nodes in the graph per GNN layer, which brings in high computation and memory costs. To alleviate this issue, several sampling-based methods~\cite{graphsage, fastgcn, ladies} have been proposed to train GNNs on a subset of nodes. However, in heterogeneous graphs, nodes an edges within different types cannot be treated equally, as the number and degree distribution of nodes in different types can be significantly different. For example, the number of venue nodes is far less than the number of paper nodes. Therefore, directly using these sampling algorithms to heterogeneous graphs are prone to get sub-graphs that are extremely imbalanced regarding node and edge types. Obviously, such imbalanced sub-graphs are not appropriate to train GNNs. Therefore, we should design a new sampling algorithm specifically for such heterogeneous graphs.


Based on the previous discussion, a promising sampling algorithm for heterogeneous graphs should: (1) Keep a similar number of nodes and edges for each type; (2) Keep the sampled graph dense, to minimize information loss and reduce sample variance. Following these two requirements, we design a mini-batch Heterogeneous Graph Sampling algorithm. The basic idea is that we keep a separate node budget  for each node type , and sample an equal number of nodes per type. Given a set of nodes already sampled, we add all their direct neighbors into the corresponding budget with Algorithm~\ref{alg:budget}, and calculate their normalized degree in line~\ref{line:update}, which will then be used to calculate sampling probability. Such normalization is equivalent to accumulate the random walk probability of each sampled node to its neighborhood, which can avoid the sampling being dominated by high-degree nodes. After the budget is updated, we then calculate the sampling probability in Algorithm~\ref{alg:sample} line~\ref{line:prob}, where we calculate the square of normalized degree for each budget. As is proved in~\cite{fastgcn, ladies}, using such sampling probability can reduce the sampled variance. We sample  nodes in node type  using the calculated probability, add each node into output set, update its neighborhood to the budget and remove it out of budget in line~\ref{line:samp}-\ref{line:end}. Repeating such procedure for  times, and we get a sampled sub-graph with th depth from initial nodes. Finally, we reconstruct the adjacency matrix among the sampled nodes and return both as the mini-batch sub-graph. Using the above sampling algorithm, the sampled sub-graph contains an equal number of nodes per node type (based on the separate node budget), and sufficiently dense to reduce sampling variance (based on the normalized degree and importance sampling), and thus is suitable for training GNNs on web-scale heterogeneous graphs.

            \ENDIF
        \ENDFOR  
    \ENDFOR
\RETURN Updated Budget 
\end{algorithmic} 
\end{algorithm}


 


\subsection{Inductive Timestamp Assignment}
Till now we've assumed that each node  is assigned with a timestamp . However, in real-world heterogeneous graphs, many nodes are not associated with a fixed time. Instead, we can assign different timestamps to it. We denote these nodes as `plain' nodes. For example, the WWW conference is held in both 1974 and 2019, and the same WWW in these two years has a dramatically different research topic. Therefore, we should decide which timestamp to attach to this WWW node. 

Note that there also exist some `event' nodes that have explicit time meaning associated with it. For example, the paper node should be associated with its publication behavior and attached to its publication date. We thus propose an inductive timestamp assignment algorithm that gives `plain' nodes based on the `event' nodes it's associated with. For example, papers are `event' nodes. When we consider a paper node published in 2010, we should use 2010 as its timestamp. Also, when we consider its published venue, say WWW, it's reasonable to also use the publication year 2010 as its timestamp to calculate representation and then pass it to this paper node. Moreover, when we consider the representation of WWW@2010, we use all the papers published in WWW as its neighbors, each associated with their published time. Therefore, the relative temporal encoding used in RGT can capture the temporal dependency of this WWW@2010 node with papers at different times. Thus, we propose an inductive timestamp assignment algorithm, which is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:budget} line~\ref{line:time}. The basic idea is that we inherit the timestamp from `event' nodes that have fixed timestamp to `plain' nodes that can be associated with any time. We judge whether the candidate source node is an `event' node. If yes, like a paper published at a specific year, we keep its timestamp for capturing temporal dependency. If no, like a conference that can be associated with any timestamp, we inductively assign the target node's timestamp, such as the published year of a paper, to this `plain' node. In this way, we can adaptively assign timestamps during the sub-graph sampling procedure.


Noted that during the sampling, we can have multiple `event' nodes linked to the same `plain' node. For example, multiple papers published at different times, but both on WWW. In this case, we treat the same node with different timestamps as different, which means that in Algorithm~\ref{alg:budget} line~\ref{line:check}, we also use the associated timestamp as a judgment indicator. In this way, WWW@1974 and WWW@2019 can both occur in our sampled subgraph, linked to the same neighborhoods. However, due to the existence of relative temporal encoding, the RGT model should learn to attend differently for these two WWW nodes towards all the papers published on it in different years.

\caption{Open Academic Graph (OAG) Statistics.} 
\label{tab:stat} 
\end{table*}








In this section, we evaluate the proposed \model\ on three heterogeneous academic graph datasets. 
We conduct the Paper-Field prediction, Paper-Venue prediction, and Author Disambiguation tasks. 
We also take case studies to demonstrate how \short\ can automatically learn and extract meta paths that are important for downstream tasks\footnote{The dataset and code are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/acbull/pyHGT}.}. 


\subsection{Web-Scale Datasets}

To examine the performance of the proposed model and its real-world applications, we use the Open Academic Graph (OAG)~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/SinhaSSMEHW15,tang2008arnetminer,DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangLTDYZGWSLW19} as our experimental basis. 
OAG consists of more than 178 million nodes and 2.236 billion edges---the largest publicly available heterogeneous academic dataset. 
In addition, all papers in OAG are associated with their publication dates, spanning from 1900 to 2019. 

To test the generalization of the proposed model, we also construct two domain-specific subgraphs from OAG: the Computer Science (CS) and Medicine (Med) academic graphs. 
The graph statistics are listed in Table \ref{tab:stat}, in which P--A, P--F, P--V, A--I, and P--P denote the edges between paper and author, paper and field, paper and venue, author and institute, and the citation links between two papers. 


Both the CS and Med graphs contain tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges, making them at least one magnitude larger than the other CS (e.g., DBLP) and Med (e.g., Pubmed) academic datasets that are commonly used in existing heterogeneous GNN and heterogeneous graph mining studies. 
Moreover, the three datasets used are far more distinguishable than previously wide-adopted small citation graphs used in GNN studies, such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed~\cite{gcn,gat}, which only contain thousands of nodes. 


There are totally five node types: `Paper', `Author', `Field', `Venue', and `Institute'. 
The `Field' nodes in OAG are categorized into six levels from  to , which are organized with a hierarchical tree. Therefore, we differentiate the `Paper--Field' edges corresponding to the field level. 

In addition, we differentiate the different author orders (i.e., the first author, the last one, and others) and venue types (i.e., journal, conference, and preprint) as well. 
Finally, the `Self' type corresponds to the self-loop connection, which is widely added in GNN architectures. 
Except the `Self' relationship, which are symmetric, all other relation types  have a reverse relation type . 


\subsection{Experimental Setup}



\vpara{Tasks and Evaluation.}
We evaluate the \short\ model on four different real-world downstream tasks: the prediction of Paper--Field (), Paper--Field (), and Paper--Venue, and Author Disambiguation. 
The goal of the first three node classification tasks is to predict the correct  and  fields that each paper belongs to or the venue it is published at, respectively. 
We use different GNNs to get the contextual node representation of the paper and use a softmax output layer to get its classification label. 
For author disambiguation, we select all the authors with the same name and their associated papers. 
The task is to conduct link prediction between these papers and candidate authors. 
After getting the paper and author node representations from GNNs, we use a Neural Tensor Network to get the probability of each author-paper pair to be linked. 


For all tasks, we use papers published before the year 2015 as the training set, papers between 2015 and 2016 for validation, and papers between 2016 and 2019 as testing. 
We choose NDCG and MRR, which are two widely adopted ranking metrics~\cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0027504, DBLP:series/synthesis/2014Li}, as the evaluation metrics. 
All models are trained for 5 times and, the mean and standard variance of test performance are reported. 


\vpara{Baselines.}We compare \short\ with two classes of state-of-art graph neural networks. 
All baselines as well as our own model, 
are implemented via the PyTorch Geometric (PyG) package~\cite{pyG}. 


 The first class of GNN baselines is designed for homogeneous graphs, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)~\cite{gcn}, which simply averages the neighbor's embedding followed by linear projection. We use the implementation provided in PyG.
    \item Graph Attention Networks (GAT)~\cite{gat}, which adopts multi-head additive attention on neighbors. We use the implementation provided in PyG. 
\end{itemize}

The second class considered is several dedicated heterogeneous GNNs as baselines,  including: \begin{itemize}
    \item Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN)~\cite{DBLP:conf/esws/SchlichtkrullKB18}, which keeps a different weight for each relationship, i.e., a relation triplet. We use the implementation provided in PyG.
    \item Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HetGNN)~\cite{DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangSHSC19}, which adopts different Bi-LSTMs for different node type for aggregating neighbor information. We re-implement this model in PyG following the authors' official code.
    \item Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (HAN)~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/WangJSWYCY19} design hierarchical attentions to aggregate neighbor information via different meta paths. We re-implement this model in PyG following the authors' official code.
\end{itemize}

In addition, to systematically analyze the effectiveness of the two major components of \short, i.e., Heterogeneous weight parameterization (Heter) and Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE), we conduct an ablation study, but comparing with models that remove these components. Specifically, we use  to denote models that uses the same set of weights for all meta relations, and use  to denote models that doesn't include relative temporal encoding. By considering all the permutations, we have: \short, \short, \short and \short\footnote{Unless other stated, \short\ refers to \short.}.



We use our \sampling\ algorithm proposed in Section~\ref{sec:train} for all baseline GNNs to handle the large-scale OAG graph. To avoid data leakage, we remove out the links we aim to predict (e.g., the Paper-Field link as the label) from the sub-graph.

We compare \short\ with several state-of-art graph neural networks. 
All these baselines as well as our model\footnote{The dataset is publicly available at \url{https://www.openacademic.ai/oag/}, and the code and trained-models will be open-sourced upon publication.} are implemented via the PyTorch Geometric (PyG) package~\cite{pyG}, a GNN framework that supports fast training via graph gather/scatter operation.

Also, we also compared with GNNs that is dedicatedly designed for heterogeneous graphs, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN)~\cite{DBLP:conf/esws/SchlichtkrullKB18}, which keeps a different weight for each relationship, i.e., a relation triplet.

We re-implement this model in PyG following the authors' official code~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/chuxuzhang/KDD2019_HetGNN}}.
    \item Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (HAN)~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/WangJSWYCY19}, which adopts two layers of attentions to aggregate neighbor information via different meta paths. We re-implement this model in PyG following the authors' official code~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Jhy1993/HAN}}.
\end{itemize}

\yd{consider to remove all baselines' github links}



To further examine whether the components in our model can indeed exploit heterogeneity and temporal dependency, and eventually benefit downstream performance, we also propose two baselines as ablation study:  HGT, which uses a same set of weight for all meta relation, and HGT, which removes the relative temporal encoding component. 

As all of the baseline GNNs cannot handle the large-scale input graphs, we use 
the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm proposed in Section~\ref{sec:train} for all of them to get a sub-graph for each interested node or node pair. 
To avoid data leakage, we remove out the link we aim to predict (e.g. the Paper-Field link as the label) from this sub-graph.

\vpara{Input Features.}As we don't assume the feature of each data type belongs to the same distribution, we are free to use the most appropriate features to represent each type of node. 
For paper and author nodes, the node numbers are extremely large. Therefore, traditional node embedding algorithms are not suitable for extracting features for them. 
We, therefore, resort to the paper titles for extracting features. For each paper, we get its title text and use a pre-trained XLNet~\cite{xlnet, wolf2019transformers} to get the representation of each word in the title. We then average them weighted by each word's attention to get the title representation for each paper. The initial feature of each author is simply an average of his/her published papers' embeddings. For field, venue and institute nodes, the node numbers are small and we use the metapath2vec model~\cite{dong2017metapath2vec} to train their node embeddings by reflecting the heterogeneous network structures. 


\vpara{Implementation Details.}
The homogeneous graph neural network baselines (e.g., GCN and GAT) assume the node features belong to the same distribution, while our feature extraction doesn't fulfill this assumption. 
If we directly feed the feature into these different baselines, they are unlikely to achieve good performance. 
To make a fair comparison, for all the models, we add an adaptation layer between the input feature and the GNNs. This module simply conducts different linear projection for nodes in different node types. Such a procedure can be regarded to map heterogeneous data into the same distribution, which is also adopted in~\cite{DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangSHSC19, DBLP:conf/www/WangJSWYCY19}. 

We set the output dimension of such module as 256, and use it as the hidden dimension throughout the networks for all baselines. For all multi-head attention-based methods, we choose the head number as 8. All the GNNs keep 3 layers so that the receptive fields of each network is exactly the same. All the GNNs are optimized via AdamW optimizer~\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH19} with Cosine Annealing Learning Rate Scheduler~\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH17}. For each model, we train it for 200 epochs, select the one with the lowest validation loss as the best model.

We use the default parameters used in GNN literature and donot tune hyper-parameters. 





\subsection{Experimental Results}
We summarize the experimental results of the proposed model and baselines on three datasets in  Table ~\ref{tab:result}. 
All experiments for the four tasks are evaluated in terms of NDCG and MRR. 


The results show that in terms of both metrics, the proposed \short\ significantly and consistently outperforms all baselines for all tasks on all datasets. 
Take, for example, the Paper--Field () classification task on OAG, \short\ achieves relative performance gains over baselines by 15--19\% in terms of NDCG and 18--21\% in terms of MRR (i.e., the performance gap divided by the baseline performance). 
When compared to HAN---the best baseline for most of the cases, the average relative NDCG improvements of \short\ on the CS, Med and OAG datasets are 11, 10 and 8, respectively. 

Overall, we observe that on average, \short\ outperforms GCN, GAT, RGCN, HetGNN, and HAN by 20\% for the four tasks on all three large-scale datasets.  
Moreover, \short\ has fewer parameters and comparable batch time than all the heterogeneous graph neural network baselines, including RGCN, HetGNN, and HAN. 
This suggests that by modeling heterogeneous edges according to their meta relation schema, we are able to have better generalization with fewer resource consumption. 



\vpara{Ablation Study.}The core component in \short\ are the heterogeneous weight parameterization (Heter) and Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE).
To further analyze their effects, we conduct an ablation study by removing them from \short. 
Specifically, the model that removes heterogeneous weight parameterization, i.e., \short, drops 4\% of performance compared with the full model \short. 
By removing RTE (i.e., \short), the performance has a 2\% drop. 
The ablation study shows the significance of parameterizing with meta relations and using Relative Temporal Encoding.



In addition, we also try to implement a baseline that keeps a unique weight matrix for each relation. However, such a baseline contains too many parameters so that our experimental setting doesn't have enough GPU memory to optimize it. This also indicates that using the meta relation to parameterize weight matrices can achieve competitive performance with fewer resources.


\subsection{Case Study}

To further evaluate how  Relative Temporal Encoding (RTE) can help \short\ to capture graph dynamics, we conduct a case study showing the evolution of conference topic. 
We select 100 conferences in computer science with the highest citations, assign them three different timestamps, i.e., 2000, 2010 and 2020, and construct sub-graphs initialized by them. 
Using a trained HGT, we can get the representations for these conferences, with which we can calculate the euclidean distances between them. 
We select WWW, KDD, and NeurIPS as illustration. 
For each of them, we pick the top-5 most similar conferences (i.e., the one with the smallest euclidean distance) to show how the conference's topics evolve over time. 


As shown in Table~\ref{tab:case}, these venues' relationships have changed from 2000 to 2020. 
For example, WWW in 2000 was more related to some database conferences, i.e., SIGMOD and VLDB, and some networking conferences, i.e., NSDI and GLOBECOM. 
However,  WWW in 2020 would become more related to some data mining and information retrieval conferences (KDD, SIGIR, and WSDM), in addition to SIGMOD and GLOBECOM. 
Also, KDD in 2000 was more related to traditional database and data mining venues, while in 2020 it will tend to correlate with a variety of topics, i.e. machine learning (NeurIPS), database (SIGMOD), Web (WWW), AI (AAAI), and NLP (EMNLP). 
Additionally, our \short\ model can capture the difference brought by new conferences. 
For example, NeurIPS in 2020 would relate with ICLR, which is a newly organized deep learning conference. 
This case study shows that the relative temporal encoding can help capture the temporal evolution of the heterogeneous academic graphs.

\subsection{Visualize Meta Relation Attention}
To illustrate how the incorporated meta relation schema can benefit the heterogeneous message passing process, we pick the schema that has the largest attention value in each of the first two \short\ layers and plot the meta relation attention hierarchy tree in Figure~\ref{fig:meta}. 
For example, to calculate a paper's representation, 
Paper, , Venue, , Paper, 
Paper, , Field, , Paper, 
and Institute, , Author, , Paper
are the three most important meta relation sequences, which can be regarded as meta paths \textit{PVP, PFP,} and \textit{IAP}, respectively. 
Note that these meta paths and their importance are automatically learned from the data without manual design.  
Another example of calculating an author node's representation is shown on the right. 
Such visualization demonstrates that \model\ is capable of implicitly learning to construct important meta paths for specific downstream tasks, without manual customization.

\subsection{Dataset Description}

To test our proposed model's performance on real-world heterogeneous and dynamic web-scale graph, we choose Open Academic Graph (OAG)~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/SinhaSSMEHW15, DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangLTDYZGWSLW19}, the largest public heterogeneous academic graph, as our experimental datasets. 
We define the heterogeneous graph schema of OAG as in table~\ref{tab:schema}. There are totally 5 node types: `Paper', `Author', `Field', `Venue' and `Institute'. For edges, unlike many previous works on heterogeneous academic graphs that only has a small number of edge relations, in this paper we define totally 32 edge types. For example, the `Fields' in the OAG are categorized into six levels from  to , which is organized with a hierarchical tree (We use `Within' and `Within' to represent such hierarchy). Therefore, we differentiate the `Paper-Field' edges in the corresponding field levels. We also differentiate the different author order and venue type as well. In addition to direct edge, we also add some higher-order edges to enrich the graph. For example, a paper can have multiple authors, and thus the `A-P-A' path can represent co-authorship. We also use `A-P-F', `A-P-V', `I-A-P-A-I' paths to augment the graph. The `Self' type corresponds to self-loop connection, which is widely added in GNN architecture. Despite `Self' and `CoAuthor' edge relationship, which are symmetric, all other edge type will have a reverse edge type. 

To test the generalization of our proposed model, we construct two main fields of OAG, the Computer Science (CS) and Medicine (Med). We select the papers with  field as CS or Med, and reconstruct two domain-specific datasets CS-OAG and Med-OAG associated with these papers. We also test the result for the whole graph, as All-OAG. The statistics of these three datasets are shown in table~\ref{tab:stat}. The All-OAG contains 0.178 billion nodes and 3.01 billion edges, spanning papers from 1900 to 2019. Till now, this is the largest-scale graph data to evaluate performance of GNNs, which is far more distinguishable than previously wide-adopted small citation graph, such as Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed~\cite{gcn}, which only contain thousands of nodes.



\subsection{Implementation and Baselines}

To test whether our proposed method can learn good representation for each type of nodes in web-scale heterogeneous graphs, we choose four different real-world downstream tasks as evaluation: Paper-Field (L1), Paper-Field (L2), Paper-Venue, and Author Disambiguation. In the first three tasks, we give a model a paper and wants it to predict the correct L1, L2 field it belongs to or the venue it's published on. We model such problem as a node classification problem, where we use GNN to get the contextual node representation of the paper, and use a softmax output layer to get its classification label. For author disambiguation, we pick all the authors with same name, and the papers that link to one of these same-name author nodes. The task is to conduct link prediction between paper and candidate authors. After getting the paper and author node representation from GNN, we use a DistMult operator~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/YangYHGD14a} to get the probability of each author-paper pair to be linked. We choose NDCG and MRR, which are two widely adopted ranking metric~\cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0027504, DBLP:series/synthesis/2014Li}, as the evaluation measures.


For all these tasks and all datasets, we use papers published before year 2015 as training, between 2015 and 2016 for validation, and paper after 2016 as testing. For each node or pair of nodes we are considering, we use the sampling algorithm discussed in Section~\ref{sec:train} to get a sub-graph, and remove out the link we want to predict (e.g. Paper-Field link) from this graph to avoid data leakage.

As we don't assume the feature of each data type belongs to the same distribution, we are free to use the most appropriate feature to represent each type of nodes. For paper and author nodes, the node number is extremely large. Therefore, traditional node embedding algorithm is not suitable for extracting features for them. We therefore resort to the paper title as feature. For each paper, we get their title text, and use a pre-trained XLNet~\cite{xlnet, wolf2019transformers} to get representation of each word in the title. We then average them weighted by each word attention to get title representation for each paper. The initial feature of each author is simply an average of his/her published paper's embedding. For field, venue and institute, the node number is small and we can train a node embedding by reflect sub-network structure. \zn{which graph to train on, which network embedding algorithm? }
\zn{Add a table to describe dataset and task statistics if there is some space left}

We compare HGT with some state-of-art graph neural networks. All these baselines as well as our own model\footnote{The dataset is publicly available at \url{https://www.openacademic.ai/oag/}, and the code and trained-models will be open-sourced upon publication.} are implemented via PyTorch Geometric (PyG) package~\cite{pyG}, a GNN framework that supports fast training via graph gather/scatter operation. The first class of GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)~\cite{gcn}, which simply average the neighbor's embedding followed by linear projection. We use the implementation provided in PyG~\footnote{\url{https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/torch_geometric/nn/conv/graph_conv.html}}.
    \item Graph Attention Networks (GAT)~\cite{gat}, which adopts multi-head additive attention on neighbors. We use the implementation provided in PyG~\footnote{\url{https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/torch_geometric/nn/conv/gat_conv.html}}. 
\end{itemize}
We also compared with GNNs that dedicatedly designed for heterogeneous graphs, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN)~\cite{DBLP:conf/esws/SchlichtkrullKB18}, which keeps a different weight for each relationship, i.e., a relation triplet. We use the implementation provided in PyG~\footnote{\url{https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/torch_geometric/nn/conv/rgcn_conv.html}}.
    \item Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HetGNN)~\cite{DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangSHSC19}, which adopts different Bi-LSTMs for different node type for aggregating neighbor information. We re-implement this model in PyG following the authors' official code~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/chuxuzhang/KDD2019_HetGNN}}.
    \item Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (HAN)~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/WangJSWYCY19}, which adopts two layers of attentions to aggregate neighbor information via different meta paths. We re-implement this model in PyG following the authors' official code~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Jhy1993/HAN}}.
\end{itemize}

To further examine whether the components in our model can indeed exploit heterogeneity and temporal dependency, and eventually benefit downstream performance, we also propose two baselines as ablation study:  HGT, which uses a same set of weight for all meta relation, and HGT, which removes the relative temporal encoding component. 

As most of these graph neural network baselines assume the node features belong to the same distribution, while our feature extraction doesn't fulfill this assumption, if we directly feed the feature into these different baselines, they are unlikely to achieve good performance. To make fair comparison, for all the models, we add an adaptation layer between the input feature and the GNNs. This module simply conducts different linear projection for nodes in different node types. Such procedure can be regarded to map heterogeneous data into same distribution, which is also adopted in~\cite{DBLP:conf/kdd/ZhangSHSC19, DBLP:conf/www/WangJSWYCY19}. We set the output dimension of such module as 256, and use as the hidden dimension throughout the networks for all baselines. For all multi-head attention-based methods, we choose head number as 8. All the GNNs keep 3 layers, so that the receptive fields of each network is exactly the same. All the GNNs are optimized via AdamW optimizer~\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH19} with Cosine Annealing Learning Rate Scheduler~\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH17}. For each model, we train it for 200 epochs, select the one with lowest validation loss as the best model. We train the model for 5 times and calculate the mean and standard variance of test performance. 


\subsection{Performance Analysis}

Table ~\ref{tab:result} summarizes the performance of HGT and baselines for different datasets and tasks. The results show that our proposed HGT significantly enhance the performance for all tasks. Compared to the current state-of-the-art method, HAN~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/WangJSWYCY19}, the average relative NDCG improvements (i.e., the performance difference  divided  by the baseline  performance) of HGT on CS-OAG, Med-OAG and All-OAG datasets are 24.0, 17.5 and 14.6 respectively. Moreover, HGT has less parameters than all the heterogeneous graph neural network baselines, including RGCN, HetGNN and HAN. This shows that by modelling relationship by its meta schema, it's possible to have better generalization with few resource consumption. 

The two most important components of HGT is the meta relation parametrization and temporal encoding. To further analyze their effect, we conduct ablation study by removing each component: HGT only maintains a single set of parameter for all relations, which is equivalent to vanilla Transformer applied on graph, while HGT discards the relative temporal encoding. We can see that after removing these two components, the NDCG performance drop 7.4 and 3.8 respectively, indicating the importance of both heterogeneous weight parametrization and temporal encoding. Among these two components, heterogeneity is more informative for the academic graph modelling. Also, we try to implement a baseline that keeps a different weight matrix for each relation. However, such a baseline contains too many parameters so that our experimental setting doesn't have enough GPU memory to optimize it. This also indicates that using heterogeneous schema to parametrize weight matrics can achieve good performance with fewer resources.

\subsection{Case Study: Venue Similarity Evolution}

To further evaluate how our proposed model can capture graph dynamics, we conduct a case study showing the evolution of conference similarity. We select 100 conferences in computer science with highest citation, assign them three different timestamps, i.e., 2000, 2010 and 2020, and construct sub-graphs initialized by them. Using a trained HGT, we can get venue representations for these conferences, with which we can calculate their mutual distance with euclidean distance. We select WWW, KDD, NeurIPS and ACL as illustration. For each of these conference, we pick top-5 most similar venues (i.e., with smallest euclidean distance) with it, showing how the conference topic might change. 

As is shown in table~\ref{tab:case}, these venues's relationship has changed from 2000 to 2020. For example, in 2000, WWW is more related to some database conferences, such as SIGMOD and VLDB, and some network conferences, such as NSDI and GLOBECOM. While WWW in 2020 becomes more related to some data mining and information retrieval conferences as KDD, SIGIR and WSDM. Also, KDD in 2000 is 
more related with some traditional database and data engineering conferences, including SIGMOD and ICDE. While in 2020, it has a trend to correlates with some machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS, AAAI. Also, our model can capture the difference brought by new conference. For example, NeurIPS in 2020 is relates with ICLR, which is a newly organized conference. This case study shows that our proposed relative temporal encoding mechanism can help capture the temporal differences and dependency.

\subsection{Visualize Meta Relation Attention}
To illustrate how the incorporated meta relation schema can benefit the GNN message passing, we pick out the largest attention value associated with each relation schema in first two layers, and plot the meta relation attention hierarchy tree. As is shown in figure~\ref{fig:meta}, to calculate a paper's representation, Paper, Pub, Venue, Pub, Paper, Paper, In, Field, In, Paper and Field, In, Author, Write, Paper are the three most important meta relation sequence, or can be regarded as meta path. Similar result is shown for author. Such visualization indicates that HGT can automatically learn to construct important meta paths for a specific downstream task, without specific domain knowledge.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}



In this paper, we propose the \model\ (\short) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. 
To model heterogeneity, we use the meta relation  to decompose the interaction and transform matrices, enabling the model to have the similar modeling capacity with fewer resources.
To capture graph dynamics, we present the relative temporal encoding  (RTE) technique to incorporate temporal information using limited computational resources. 
To conduct efficient and scalable training of \short\ on Web-scale data, we design the heterogeneous Mini-Batch graph sampling algorithm---\sampling. 
We conduct comprehensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph, and show that the proposed \short\ model can capture both heterogeneity and outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines on various downstream tasks.

In the future, we will explore whether \short\ is able to generate heterogeneous graphs, e.g., predict new papers and their titles, and whether we can pre-train \short\ to benefit tasks with scarce labels.
