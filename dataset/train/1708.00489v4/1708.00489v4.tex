\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to many recognition and learning tasks using a universal recipe;
    training a deep model on a very large dataset of supervised examples. However, this approach is rather restrictive in practice since collecting a
    large set of labeled images is very expensive. One way to ease this problem is coming up with smart ways for choosing images to be labelled from a
    very large collection (\ie active learning).

    Our empirical study suggests that many of the active learning heuristics in the literature are not effective when applied to CNNs in batch setting. Inspired by these limitations, we define the problem of active learning as \emph{core-set selection}, \ie choosing set of points such that a model learned over the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points. We further present a theoretical result characterizing the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the datapoints. As an active learning algorithm, we choose the subset which is expected to yield best result according to our characterization. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in image classification experiments by a large margin.

\section{introduction}
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown unprecedented success in many areas of research in computer vision and pattern recognition, such as
image classification, object detection, and scene segmentation. Although CNNs are universally successful in many tasks, they have a major drawback;
they need a very large amount of labeled data to be able to learn their large number of parameters. More importantly, it is almost always better to have
more data since the accuracy of CNNs is often not saturated with increasing dataset size. Hence, there is a constant desire to collect more and more
data. Although this a desired behavior from an algorithmic perspective (higher representative power is typically better), labeling a dataset is
a time consuming and an expensive task. These practical considerations raise a critical question: \emph{``what is the optimal way to choose data
points to label such that the highest accuracy can be obtained given a fixed labeling budget.''} Active learning is one of the common paradigms to
address this question.

The goal of active learning is to find effective ways to choose data points to label, from a pool of unlabeled data points, in order to maximize the
accuracy. Although it is not possible to obtain a universally good active learning strategy \citep{dasgupta2004analysis}, there exist many
heuristics~\citep{settles2010active} which have been proven to be effective in practice. Active learning is typically an iterative process in which a
model is learned at each iteration and a set of points is chosen to be labelled from a pool of unlabelled points using these aforementioned heuristics. We experiment
with many of these heuristics in this paper and find them not effective when applied to CNNs. We argue that
the main factor behind this ineffectiveness is the correlation caused via batch acquisition/sampling. In the classical setting, the active learning algorithms
typically choose a single point at each iteration; however, this is not feasible for CNNs since i) a single point is likely to have no statistically
significant impact on the accuracy due to the local optimization methods, and ii) each iteration requires a full training until convergence which
makes it intractable to query labels one-by-one. Hence, it is necessary to query labels for a large subset at each iteration and it results in correlated samples even for
moderately small subset sizes.

In order to tailor an active learning method for the batch sampling case, we decided to define the active learning as \emph{core-set selection} problem. Core-set selection problem aims to find a small subset given a large labeled dataset such that a model learned over the small subset is competitive over the whole dataset. Since
we have no labels available, we perform the core-set selection without using
the labels. In order to attack the unlabeled core-set problem for CNNs, we provide a rigorous bound between an average loss over any given subset of the dataset and
the remaining data points via the geometry of the data points. As an active learning algorithm, we try to choose a subset such that this bound is minimized. Moreover, minimization of this bound turns out to be equivalent to the k-Center problem~\citep{facility} and we adopt an efficient approximate solution to this 
combinatorial optimization problem. We further study the behavior of our proposed algorithm empirically for the problem of image classification using three different datasets. Our empirical analysis demonstrates state-of-the-art performance by a large margin. 


\section{Related Work} We discuss the related work in the following categories
separately. Briefly, our work is different from existing approaches in that 
it defines the active learning problem as core-set selection,  we consider
both fully supervised and weakly supervised cases, and  we rigorously
address the core-set selection problem directly for CNNs with no extra
assumption. 


\noindent\textbf{Active Learning} Active learning has been widely studied and
most of the early work can be found in the classical survey
of \citet{settles2010active}. It covers acquisition functions such as
information theoretical methods \citep{mackay1992information}, ensemble
approaches \citep{mccallumzy1998employing, freund1997selective} and uncertainty
based methods
\citep{tong2001support,joshi2009multi,li2013adaptive}.

Bayesian active learning methods typically use a non-parametric model like
Gaussian process to estimate the expected improvement by each query
\citep{kapoor2007active} or the expected error after a set of queries
\citep{roy2001toward}. These approaches are not directly applicable to large CNNs since they do not scale to large-scale datasets. A recent approach by~\citet{gal_bayes} shows an equivalence between dropout and approximate
Bayesian inference enabling the application of Bayesian methods to deep
learning. Although Bayesian active learning has been shown to be effective
for small datasets \citep{gal_active}, our empirical analysis suggests that they do not scale to large-scale datasets because of batch sampling.

One important class is that of uncertainty based methods, which try to find hard
examples using heuristics like highest entropy \citep{joshi2009multi}, and
geometric distance to decision boundaries
\citep{tong2001support,brinker2003incorporating}. Our empirical analysis find them not to be effective for CNNs.


There are recent optimization based approaches which can trade-off uncertainty
and diversity to obtain a diverse set of hard examples in batch mode active learning setting. Both
\citet{elhamifar2013convex} and \citet{yang2015multi} design a discrete optimization problem for this
purpose and use its convex surrogate. Similarly, \citet{guo2010} cast a similar problem as matrix partitioning. However, the optimization algorithms proposed in these papers use 
variables where  is the number of data points. Hence, they do not scale to
large datasets. There are also many pool based active
learning algorithms designed for the specific class of machine learning
algorithms like k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes \citep{wei2015submodularity}, logistic regression \cite{hoi_et_al, guo_et_al}, and linear regression with Gaussian noise \citep{yu2006active}.
Even in the algorithm agnostic case, one can design a set-cover algorithm to
cover the hypothesis space using sub-modularity \citep{guillory2010interactive,
golovin2011adaptive}. On the other hand, \citet{demir2011batch} uses a heuristic to first filter the pool based on uncertainty and then choose point to label using diversity. Our algorithm can be considered to be in this class;
however, we do not use any uncertainty information. Our algorithm is also the
first one which is applied to the CNNs. Most similar to ours are \citep{porikli} and \citep{kdd13}. \citet{porikli}
uses a similar optimization problem. However, they offer no theoretical
justification or analysis. \citet{kdd13} proposes to use empirical risk minimization like us; however, they try to minimize the difference between two distributions (maximum mean discrepancy between iid. samples from the dataset and the actively selected samples) instead of core-set loss. Moreover, both algorithms are also not experimented with CNNs. In our experimental study, we compare with \citep{kdd13}.

Recently, a discrete optimization based method \citep{BerlindU15} which is
similar to ours has been presented for k-NN type algorithms in the domain shift
setting. Although our theoretical analysis borrows some techniques from them, their results are only valid for k-NNs.

Active learning algorithms for CNNs are also recently presented in
\citep{wang2016cost, captcha}. \citet{wang2016cost} propose an heuristic based algorithm which directly assigns
labels to the data points with high confidence and queries labels for the ones
with low confidence. Moreover, \citet{captcha} specifically targets recognizing CAPTCHA images. Although their results are promising for CAPTCHA recognition, their method is not effective for image classification. We discuss limitations of both approaches in Section~\ref{sec:exp}.

On the theoretical side, it is shown that greedy active learning is not possible in algorithm and data agnostic case~\citep{NIPS2004_2636}. However, there are data dependent results showing that it is indeed possible to obtain a query strategy which has better sample complexity than querying all points. These results either use assumptions about data-dependent realizability of the hypothesis space like \citep{gonen2013efficient} or a data dependent measure of the concept space called disagreement coefficient \citep{hanneke2007bound}. It is also possible to perform active learning in a batch setting using the greedy algorithm via importance sampling \citep{ganti2012upal}. Although the aforementioned algorithms enjoy theoretical guarantees, they do not apply to large-scale problems.

\noindent\textbf{Core-Set Selection} The closest literature to our
work is the problem of core-set selection since we define active learning as a
core-set selection problem. This problem considers a
fully labeled dataset and tries to choose a subset of it such that the model
trained on the selected subset will perform as closely as possible to the model
trained on the entire dataset. For specific learning algorithms, there are
methods like core-sets for SVM \citep{tsang2005core} and core-sets for k-Means
and k-Medians \citep{har2005smaller}. However, we are not aware of such a method for CNNs.

The most similar algorithm to ours is the unsupervised subset selection
algorithm in \citep{wei2013using}. It uses a facility location problem
to find a diverse cover for the dataset. Our algorithm differs in that it uses a
slightly different formulation of facility location problem. Instead of the
min-sum, we use the minimax \citep{facility} form. More
importantly, we apply this algorithm for the first time to the problem of active
learning and provide theoretical guarantees for CNNs.
 
\noindent\textbf{Weakly-Supervised Deep Learning} Our paper is also related to
semi-supervised deep learning since we experiment the active learning both in
the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised scheme. One of the early
weakly-supervised convolutional neural network algorithms was Ladder networks
\citep{ladder}. Recently, we have seen adversarial methods which can learn a data
distribution as a result of a two-player non-cooperative game
\citep{salimans2016improved, gan_original, dcgan}. These methods are further
extended to feature learning \citep{ali, bigan}. We use Ladder networks in our
experiments; however, our method is agnostic to the weakly-supervised learning algorithm choice and can
utilize any model.

\section{Problem Definition} In this section, we formally define the problem of active learning in the batch setting and set
up the notation for the rest of the paper. We are interested in a  class classification problem defined over a
compact space  and a label space  . We also consider a loss function
 parametrized over the hypothesis class
(), e.g.\ parameters of the deep learning algorithm. We further assume class-specific regression functions
 to be \mbox{-Lipschitz} continuous for all .

We consider a large collection of data points which are sampled  over the space
 as \mbox{} where
. We further consider an initial pool of data-points chosen uniformly at random as
\mbox{}.

An active learning algorithm only has access to  and . In other
words, it can only see the labels of the points in the initial sub-sampled pool. It is also given a budget  of
queries to ask an oracle, and a learning algorithm  which outputs a set of parameters  given
a labelled set . The active learning with a pool problem can simply be defined as 

 

In other words, an active learning algorithm can choose  extra points and get them labelled by an oracle to minimize
the future expected loss. There are a few differences between our formulation and the classical definition of active
learning. Classical methods consider the case in which the budget is 1 () but a single point has negligible effect
in a deep learning regime hence we consider the batch case. It is also very common to consider multiple rounds of this
game. We also follow the multiple round formulation with a myopic approach by solving the single round of labelling as;

We only discuss the first iteration where  for brevity although we apply it over multiple rounds. 

At each iteration, an active learning algorithm has two stages: 1. identifying a set of data-points and presenting them
to an oracle to be labelled, and 2. training a classifier using both the new and the previously labeled data-points. The
second stage (training the classifier) can be done in a fully or weakly-supervised manner. Fully-supervised is the case
where training the classifier is done using only the labeled data-points. Weakly-supervised is the case where training
also utilizes the points which are not labelled yet. Although the existing literature only focuses on the active
learning for fully-supervised models, we consider both cases and experiment on both. 

\section{Method} 
\subsection{Active Learning as a Set Cover} 
In the classical active learning setting, the algorithm acquires
labels one by one by querying an oracle (\ie ). Unfortunately, this is not feasible when training CNNs since 
a single point will not have a statistically significant impact on the model due to the local optimization algorithms.
 it is infeasible to train as many models as number of points since many practical problem of interest is very
large-scale. Hence, we focus on the batch active learning problem in
which the active learning algorithm choose a moderately large set of points to be labelled by an oracle at each
iteration.

In order to design an active learning strategy which is effective in batch setting, we consider the following upper
bound of the active learning loss we formally defined in (\ref{eq:expectation}):
{ \small 
 }
The quantity we are interested in is the population risk of the model learned using a small labelled subset ().
The population risk is controlled by the \emph{training error} of the model on the labelled subset, the \emph{generalization error} over the
full dataset () and a term we define as the \emph{core-set loss}. Core-set loss is simply the
difference between average empirical loss over the set of points which have labels for and the average empirical loss over the entire
dataset including unlabelled points. Empirically, it is widely observed that the CNNs are highly expressive leading to very low training error and they typically generalize well for various visual problems. Moreover, generalization error of CNNs is also theoretically studied and shown to be bounded by \citet{robust}. Hence, the critical part for active learning is the core-set loss. Following this observation, we re-define the active learning problem as:
 
Informally, given the initial labelled set () and the budget (), we are trying to find a set of points
to query labels () such that when we learn a model, the performance of the model on the labelled subset
and that on the whole dataset will be as close as possible.

\subsection{Core-Sets for CNNs} 
The optimization objective we define in (\ref{eq:new_active_learning}) is not directly computable since we do not have
access to all the labels (\ie  is unlabelled). Hence, in this section we
give an upper bound for this objective function which we can optimize. 

We start with presenting this bound for any loss function which is Lipschitz for a fixed true label  and parameters , and then show that loss functions of CNNs with ReLu non-linearities satisfy this property. We also rely on the zero training error assumption. Although the zero training error is not an entirely realistic assumption,  our experiments suggest that the resulting upper bound is very effective. We state the following theorem;
\begin{theorem} Given  i.i.d. samples drawn from  as , and set of
    points . If loss function  is -Lipschitz continuous
    for all  and bounded by , regression function is -Lipschitz, 
    is  cover of , and
    ; with probability at least ,

\label{mainthm2} \end{theorem}

Since we assume a zero training error for core-set, the core-set loss is equal to the average error over entire dataset as \mbox{}. We state the theorem in this form to be consistent with (3). We visualize this theorem in Figure~\ref{fig:thm} and defer its proof to the appendix. In this theorem, ``a set  is a  cover of a set ''  means a set of balls with radius
 centered at each member of  can cover the entire . Informally, this theorem suggests that we can bound the core-set loss with covering radius and a term which goes to
zero with rate depends solely on . This is an interesting result since this bound does not depend on the number of labelled points. In
other words, a provided label does not help the core-set loss unless it decreases the covering radius.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{thm.pdf} \end{center} 
        \caption{\textbf{Visualization of the Theorem \ref{mainthm2}}. Consider the set of selected points

        }
    \label{fig:thm}
    \end{figure}

In order to show that this bound applies to CNNs, we prove the Lipschitz-continuity of the loss function of a CNN with respect to input image for a fixed true label with the following lemma where max-pool and restricted linear units are the non-linearities and the loss is defined as the  distance between the desired class probabilities and the soft-max outputs. CNNs are typically used with cross-entropy loss for classification problems in the literature. Indeed, we also perform our experiments using the cross-entropy loss although we use  loss in our theoretical study. Although our theoretical study does not extend to cross-entropy loss, our experiments suggest that the resulting algorithm is very effective for cross-entropy loss.

\begin{lemma} 
Loss function defined as the 2-norm between the class
probabilities and the softmax output of a convolutional neural network with  convolutional (with max-pool and ReLU) and  fully connected layers defined over C classes is -Lipschitz function of input for fixed class probabilities and network parameters. \end{lemma}

Here,  is the maximum sum of  input weights per neuron (see appendix for formal definition). Although it is in
general unbounded, it can be made arbitrarily small without changing the loss function behavior (\ie keeping the label
of any data point  unchanged). We defer the proof to the appendix and conclude that CNNs enjoy the bound we
presented in Theorem~\ref{mainthm2}.

In order to computationally perform active learning, we use this upper bound. In other words, the practical problem of interest becomes . This problem is equivalent to the k-Center problem (also called min-max facility location problem) \citep{facility}. In the next section, we explain how we solve the k-Center problem in practice using a greedy approximation.{\parfillskip0pt\par}

\end{wrapfigure}  

\subsection{Solving the k-Center Problem} 
\label{sec:alg} 
We have so far provided an upper bound for the loss function of the core-set selection problem and showed that minimizing it is equivalent to the \emph{k-Center} problem (minimax facility location \citep{facility}) which can intuitively be defined as follows; choose  center points such that the  largest distance between a data point and its nearest center is minimized. Formally, we are trying to solve: 


Unfortunately this problem is NP-Hard \citep{cook}. However, it is possible to obtain a  solution efficiently
using a greedy approach shown in  Algorithm~\ref{alg:greedy}. If , the greedy algorithm shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:greedy} is proven to have a solution () such that; .


Although the greedy algorithm gives a good initialization, in practice we can improve the  solution by
iteratively querying upper bounds on the optimal value. In other words, we can design an algorithm which decides if . In order to do so, we define a mixed integer program (MIP) parametrized by  such that its
feasibility indicates . A straight-forward algorithm would be to use this MIP as a sub-routine and
performing a binary search between the result of the greedy algorithm and its half since the optimal solution is
guaranteed to be included in that range. While constructing this MIP, we also try to handle one of the weaknesses of
k-Center algorithm, namely robustness. To make the k-Center problem robust, we assume an upper limit on the number of
outliers  such that our algorithm can choose not to cover at most  unsupervised data points. This mixed
integer program can be written as:




In this formulation,  is 1 if the  data point is chosen as center,  is  if the 
point is covered by the , point and  is 1 if the  point is an outlier and covered by the
 point without the  constraint, and  otherwise. And, variables are binary as . We further visualize these variables in a diagram in Figure~\ref{mip}, and give the details of
the method in Algorithm~\ref{alg:bin}.

\end{figure*}


\subsection{Implementation Details} \label{sec:imp} One of the critical design choices is the distance metric
. We use the  distance between activations of the final fully-connected layer as the distance.
For weakly-supervised learning, we used Ladder networks \citep{ladder} and for all experiments we used VGG-16 \citep{vgg}
as the CNN architecture. We initialized all convolutional filters according to \citet{he_et_al}. We optimized all models using RMSProp with a learning rate of  using
Tensorflow~\citep{tensorflow}. We train CNNs from scratch after each iteration. 

We used the Gurobi~\citep{gurobi} framework for checking feasibility of the MIP defined in (\ref{eqmip}). As an upper bound on outliers, we used  where  is the
number of unlabelled points.


\section{Experimental Results} \label{sec:exp} We tested our algorithm on the problem of classification using three
different datasets. We performed experiments on CIFAR~\citep{cifar} dataset for
image classification and on SVHN\citep{svhn} dataset for digit classification. CIFAR~\citep{cifar} dataset has two
tasks; one coarse-grained over 10 classes and one fine-grained over 100 classes. We performed experiments on both.

We compare our method with the following baselines: \textbf{Random:} Choosing the points to be labelled uniformly at
random from the unlabelled pool. \textbf{Best Empirical Uncertainty:} Following the empirical setup in
\citep{gal_active}, we perform active learning using max-entropy, BALD and Variation Ratios treating soft-max outputs as
probabilities. We only report the best performing one for each dataset since they perform similar to each other. 
\textbf{Deep Bayesian Active Learning (DBAL)\citep{gal_active}:} We perform Monte Carlo dropout to obtain improved uncertainty measures and report
only the best performing acquisition function among max-entropy, BALD and Variation Ratios for each dataset. 
\textbf{Best Oracle Uncertainty:} We also report a best performing oracle algorithm which uses the label information for
entire dataset. We replace the uncertainty with  for all unlabelled examples. We
sample the queries from the normalized form of this function by setting the probability of choosing the  point
to be queried as . \textbf{k-Median:} Choosing the points to be labelled as the cluster centers of k-Median (k is equal to the budget) algorithm. \textbf{Batch Mode Discriminative-Representative Active Learning(BMDR)\citep{kdd13}:} ERM based approach which uses uncertainty and minimizes MMD between iid. samples from the dataset and the actively chosen points. \textbf{CEAL \citep{wang2016cost}:} CEAL \citep{wang2016cost} is a weakly-supervised active learning method proposed
specifically for CNNs. we include it in the weakly-supervised analysis.


We conducted experiments on active learning for fully-supervised models as well as active learning for weakly-supervised
models. In our experiments, we start with small set of images sampled uniformly at random from the dataset as an initial
pool. The weakly-supervised model has access to labeled examples as well as unlabelled examples. The fully-supervised
model only has access to the labeled data points. We run all experiments with five random initializations of the initial
pool of labeled points and use the average classification accuracy as a metric. We plot the accuracy vs the number of
labeled points. We also plot error bars as standard deviations. We run the query algorithm iteratively; in other
words, we solve the discrete optimization problem  for each point on the accuracy
vs number of labelled examples graph. We present the results in Figures~\ref{fig:ressemi} and \ref{fig:resnosemi}.

\begin{figure}[tb]

        \vspace{-5mm}
    \label{fig:ress}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:resns} and \ref{fig:ress} suggests that our algorithm outperforms all other baselines in all
experiments; for the case of weakly-supervised models, by a large margin. We believe the effectiveness of our approach
in the weakly-supervised case is due to the better feature learning. Weakly-supervised models provide better feature
spaces resulting in accurate geometries. Since our method is geometric, it performs significantly better with better
feature spaces. We also observed that our algorithm is less effective in CIFAR-100 when compared with
CIFAR-10 and SVHN. This can easily be explained using our theoretical analysis. Our bound over the core-set loss scales with the
number of classes, hence it is better to have fewer classes.

One interesting observation is the fact that a state-of-the-art batch mode active learning baseline (BMDR \citep{kdd13}) does not necessarily perform better than greedy ones. We believe this is due to the fact that it still uses an uncertainty information and soft-max probabilities are not a good proxy for uncertainty. Our method does not use any uncertainty. And, incorporating uncertainty to our method in a principled way is an open problem and a fruitful future research direction. On the other hand, a pure clustering based batch active learning baseline (k-Medoids) is also not effective. We believe this is rather intuitive since cluster sentences are likely the points which are well covered with initial iid. samples. Hence, this clustering based method fails to sample the tails of the data distribution.

Our results suggest that both oracle uncertainty information and Bayesian estimation of uncertainty is helpful since they improve over empirical uncertainty baseline; however, they are still not effective in the batch setting since random sampling outperforms them. We believe this is due to the correlation in the queried labels as a consequence of active learning in batch setting. We further investigate this with a qualitative analysis via
tSNE \citep{tsne} embeddings. We compute embeddings for all points using the features which are learned using the
labelled examples and visualize the points sampled by our method as well as the oracle uncertainty. This visualization
suggests that due to the correlation among samples, uncertainty based methods fail to cover the large portion of the
space confirming our hypothesis.



\noindent\textbf{Optimality of the k-Center Solution:} Our proposed method uses the greedy 2-OPT solution for the
k-Center problem as an initialization and checks the feasibility of a mixed integer program (MIP). We use
LP-relaxation of the defined MIP and use branch-and-bound to obtain integer solutions. The utility obtained by solving
this expensive MIP should be investigated. We compare the average run-time of MIP\footnote{On Intel Core
i7-5930K@3.50GHz and 64GB memory} with the run-time of 2-OPT solution in Table~\ref{tab:runtime}. We also compare the
accuracy obtained with optimal k-Center solution and the 2-OPT solution in Figure~\ref{fig:twoopt} on CIFAR-100 dataset.

As shown in the Table~\ref{tab:runtime}; although the run-time of MIP is not polynomial in worst-case, in practice it
converges in a tractable amount of time for a dataset of 50k images. Hence, our algorithm can easily be applied in
practice. Figure~\ref{fig:twoopt} suggests a small but significant drop in the accuracy when the 2-OPT solution is used.
Hence, we conclude that unless the scale of the dataset is too restrictive, using our proposed optimal solver is
desired. Even with the accuracy drop, our active learning strategy using 2-OPT solution still outperforms the other
baselines. Hence, we can conclude that our algorithm can scale to any dataset size with small accuracy drop even if
solving MIP is not feasible.


\section{Conclusion} We study the active learning problem for CNNs. Our empirical analysis showed that classical
uncertainty based methods have limited applicability to the CNNs due to the correlations caused by batch sampling. We
re-formulate the active learning problem as core-set selection and study the core-set problem for CNNs. We further
validated our algorithm using an extensive empirical study. Empirical results on three datasets showed state-of-the-art
performance by a large margin.

\section{Proof for Lemma 1}
\begin{proof}
We will start with showing that softmax function defined over  class is -Lipschitz continuous. It is easy to show that for any differentiable function \mbox{},


where  and  is the Jacobian matrix of .

Softmax function is defined as

For brevity, we will denote  as . The Jacobian matrix will be,

Now, Frobenius norm of above matrix will be,

It is straightforward to show that  is the optimal solution for  Hence, putting  in the above equation , we get \mbox{}.

Now, consider two inputs  and , such that their representation at layer  is  and . Let's consider any convolution or fully-connected layer as . If we assume, \mbox{}, for any convolutional or fully connected layer, we can state:
 
On the other hand, using  and the fact that max pool layer can be written as a convolutional layer such that only one weight is  and others are , we can state for ReLU and max-pool layers,
 

Combining with the Lipschitz constant of soft-max layer,

Using the reverse triangle inequality as

we can conclude that the loss function is -Lipschitz for any fixed  and .
\end{proof}

\section{Proof for Theorem 1}
Before starting our proof, we state the Claim 1 from \cite{BerlindU15}. Fix some  and . Then,

\begin{proof}
We will start our proof with bounding . We have a condition which states that there exists and  in  ball around  such that  has  loss.

With abuse of notation, we represent \mbox{} with \mbox{}. We use Claim 1 in , and Lipschitz property of regression function and bound of loss in . Then, we can further bound the remaining term as; 

where last step is coming from the fact that the trained classifier assumed to have  loss over training points. If we combine them,

We further use the Hoeffding's Bound and conclude that with probability at least ,
