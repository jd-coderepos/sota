\minisection{Baseline methods} We compare our approach to widely used, state-of-the-art face landmark detectors. These are DLIB~\cite{king2009dlib}, CLNF~\cite{baltrusaitis2013constrained}, OpenFace~\cite{baltruvsaitis2016openface}, CE-CLM~\cite{zadeh2016deep}, RCPR~\cite{burgos2013robust}, and 3DDFA~\cite{zhu2015}. Note that CLNF is the method used to produce our training labels. 
 
\minisection{Results} Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_conf} and~\ref{fig:exp_conf_emotiw17} report the emotion classification confusion matrices on the original CK+ and EmotiW-17 datasets (unscaled) for our method (Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_rec_conf_us} and~\ref{fig:exp_rec_conf_us_emotiw17}), comparing it to the other methods, 3DDFA (Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_rec_conf_3ddfa}) and CE-CLM / CLNF (Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_rec_conf_dclm} /~\ref{fig:exp_rec_conf_clnf_emotiw17}). 

On CK+, our expression coefficients were able to capture well surprise (Su), happy (Ha), and disgust (Di) emotions, all emotions which are well defined by facial expressions. On EmotiW-17, our method performed well on neutral (Ne), happy (Ha), sad (Sa), and angry (An), but less so on disgust (Di), fear (Fe), and surprise (Su). From our observations, these last emotions are visually similar to angry (An), which could explain why they challenged our system. On the whole, however, our representation was noticeably better at capturing all emotion classes than its baselines. 


Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_rec_scale} reports emotion classification performances of all methods on scaled versions of the CK+ (Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_rec_scale}(a)) and EmotiW-17 sets (Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_rec_scale}(b)). These results measure the sensitivity of different methods to the input image resolution: The x-axis reports the downsizing factor, proportional to the original scale. A scale of~1 therefore represents the original image sizes (640x490 for CK+; 720x576 for EmotiW-17), scale of~0.2 implies 128x98 for CK+ and 144x115 for EmotiW-17, and so fourth. 

Results in Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_rec_scale} clearly show our approach to be the most accurate in terms of emotion recognition accuracy. It is additionally far more robust to scale changes compared than the other landmark detection based methods. Note also the  difference in emotion recognition between deep methods---ours and~\cite{zhu2015}---and landmark based approaches.

Importantly, our method outperforms CLNF~\cite{baltrusaitis2013constrained} by a wide margin in all tests. This result is significant, as CLNF was the method used to generate our expression labels in Sec.~\ref{sec:gen_data}. Our improved performance suggests that the network learned to generalize from its training data and thus performed better on a wider range of viewing conditions and challenges.



\minisection{Runtime} Tab.~\ref{tab:timings} reports runtimes for the methods tested. All tests were performed on a machine with an NVIDIA, GeForce GTX TITAN X and an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2640 v3 @ 2.60GHz. The only exception was 3DDFA~\cite{zhu2015}, which required a Windows system and was tested using an Intel Core i7-4820K CPU @ 3.70GHz with 8 CPUs.


We compare landmark based approaches with deep, direct method such as 3DDFA and our ExpNet. ExpNet is at least one order of magnitude faster than any of its alternatives. Note that, landmark based expression fitting methods generally follow a three-step process: (i) facial landmark detection, (ii) head pose estimation, and (iii) expression fitting. Their total processing time is therefore the sum of these steps. Although some landmark detection methods (e.g. DLIB) are extremely efficient (0.009s), they are still required to solve the optimization problem of Eq.~(\ref{eq:expr_fitting}), in order to translate these detections to an expression coefficients estimate. This process is much slower than our proposed method.


As for deep methods for expression estimation, the software package provided by 3DDFA~\cite{zhu2015} does not allow testing on the GPU; in their paper, they report GPU runtime to be 0.076 seconds, which is similar to our runtime, which was measured on a GPU. Other facial landmarks detector based methods, including the code used to solve~Eq. (\ref{eq:expr_fitting}), are all intrinsically implemented on the CPU. Though they may conceivably be expedited significantly by porting them to the GPU, we are unaware of any such implementation.

{\em Expression estimation failures.} Our method is less able to handle extreme facial expressions. Other methods, by comparison, appear to either exaggerate the expression (3DDFA) or are inconsistent across scales (CE-CLM).

\label{fig:qual_fail}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Qualitative Results}\label{sec:qual}
Fig.~\ref{fig:qual} and~\ref{fig:qual_emotiw17} provide qualitative renderings of the 3D expressions estimated on CK+ and EmotiW-17 images. Each result was obtained on the original, input image scale (scale 1) and also at our lowest resolution (scale 0.2). All the results in these figures use the same 3D shape provided by 3DMM-CNN~\cite{tran16_3dmm_cnn}. Additional, mid level facial details can possibly be added using, e.g.,~\cite{tran2017extreme}, but to emphasize expressions, rather than details, we used only course facial shapes. 

These figures visualize expressions estimated with our ExpNet compared with the recent deep method for joint estimation of shape and expression~\cite{zhu2015}, and the top performing landmark detectors CE-CLM~\cite{zadeh2016deep}, and CLNF~\cite{baltrusaitis2013constrained}. For reference, we provide also the shape 3D face  shape~\cite{tran16_3dmm_cnn} estimated before expressions were added.


Our expression estimates appear to be much better at capturing expression nuances: This is clear from the subtle expressions, fear and anger, rendered in Fig.~\ref{fig:qual}. This is consistent with the improvement shown in the confusion matrices in Fig.\ref{fig:exp_conf}. 3DDFA appears inconsistent across the same expression (happy) and tends to either exaggerate the expression or underestimate it. Both CE-CLM and CLNF seem sensitive to input image resolutions: They both estimate different expressions for the same input image offered at different scales.

Finally, Fig.~\ref{fig:qual} demonstrates a weaknesses of our ExpNet to strong intensity expressions such as surprise. 3DDFA, by comparison, produces somewhat over-exaggerated estimates on these images. Although CE-CLM produces visually suitable estimates, its predictions are inconsistent across scales.


\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclu}
We present a method for deep, 3D expression modeling and show it to be far more robust than than facial landmark detection methods widely used for this task. Our approach estimates expressions without the use of facial landmarks, suggesting that facial landmark detection methods may be redundant for this task. This conclusion is consistent with recent results demonstrating deep, {\em landmark free} 3D face shape estimation~\cite{chang17fpn} and 6DoF head alignment~\cite{tran16_3dmm_cnn}. The significance of these results is that by avoiding facial landmark detection, we can process face images obtained in extreme viewing condition which can be challenging for landmark detection methods.
