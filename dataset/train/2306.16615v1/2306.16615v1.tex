\begin{abstract}
This study addresses the problem of 3D human mesh reconstruction from multi-view images. Recently, approaches that directly estimate the skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL)-based human mesh vertices based on volumetric heatmap representation from input images have shown good performance. We show that representation learning of vertex heatmaps using an autoencoder helps improve the performance of such approaches. Vertex heatmap autoencoder (VHA) learns the manifold of plausible human meshes in the form of latent codes using AMASS, which is a large-scale motion capture dataset. Body code predictor (BCP) utilizes the learned body prior from VHA for human mesh reconstruction from multi-view images through latent code-based supervision and transfer of pretrained weights. According to experiments on Human3.6M and LightStage datasets, the proposed method outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art human mesh reconstruction performance.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

3D human pose and mesh reconstruction from images is an interesting research topic in image processing and computer vision. It can be used in various applications such as virtual/augmented reality and human motion analysis. To date, various approaches have been proposed to address this task, and they can be roughly divided into deep learning-based~\cite{2018_Kanazawa, 2020_Shin, choi2022learning}, optimization-based~\cite{SMPLify_X_2019_Pavlakos, Bogo_ECCV_2016}, and hybrid approaches~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV, lightcap2021} that combine them.

This paper addresses the task of reconstructing a skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL)-based human mesh~\cite{2015_SMPL} from input multi-view images. To this end, we adopt a hybrid approach, namely, learnable human mesh triangulation (LMT)~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV}. LMT is a two-stage method where volumetric heatmap-based vertex regression and SMPL fitting are performed sequentially. The body prior for realistic human mesh reconstruction is used in the fitting stage but not in the vertex regression stage. Therefore, unseen test poses or lack of training data cause the vertex regression stage to produce incorrect vertex coordinates. As a result, only employing the body prior in the fitting stage has limitations in refining incorrectly estimated vertices, which causes performance degradation. To solve this problem, we learn the body prior for the vertex heatmap and use it for vertex regression. 

The proposed model consists of \emph{Vertex Heatmap Autoencoder (VHA)} for learning the human body prior, \emph{Body Code Predictor (BCP)} producing the latent code for a human mesh from multi-view images, and the fitting module that predicts the SMPL parameters. For representation learning~\cite{ radford2015unsupervised, goodfellow2016deep}, we train an autoencoder that uses vertex heatmaps as its input and output. The weights of the trained autoencoder and the latent code computed from the autoencoder implicitly contain prior knowledge on the plausible human body. BCP is trained to predict the latent code computed from VHA. We also initialize the weights of BCP with the weights of the pretrained VHA encoder. BCP can utilize the body prior learned by VHA for vertex regression through the above two processes. We feed the latent code computed from BCP into the VHA decoder to obtain human mesh vertices. The fitting module predicts SMPL parameters from mesh vertices generated by the BCP and VHA decoder. 

The human body prior has been used in many existing studies for SMPL-based human mesh reconstruction from images, but their prior is different from ours. Deep learning-based methods~\cite{2018_Kanazawa, choi2022learning} use either adversarial training or the pretrained variational autoencoder (i.e., VPoser~\cite{SMPLify_X_2019_Pavlakos}). In optimization-based methods~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV, lightcap2021, SMPLify_X_2019_Pavlakos, Bogo_ECCV_2016}, prior knowledge is generally utilized using VPoser and manually designed pose regularizing terms. These methods allow a plausible human body to be reconstructed by constraining the SMPL parameters. By contrast, our method constrains the human mesh vertices, specifically their volumetric heatmaps.

The multi-person pose estimation method proposed in~\cite{fabbri2020compressed} is similar to ours in that it performs representation learning through an autoencoder. However, its motivation is to solve the problem of excessive computation and memory usage due to volumetric heatmaps, which is different from the motivation of our method. It is also based on representation learning for skeletal joints rather than body mesh vertices, which is another noticeable difference from our method.

The contributions of our study are as follows. First, an autoencoder-based representation learning method for vertex heatmaps is proposed for the first time to our knowledge. Second, large-scale motion capture datasets such as AMASS~\cite{moshpp_AMASS_2019} can be used for representation learning, which helps improve the generalization performance of the proposed mesh reconstruction method. Third, our mesh reconstruction model can be efficiently trained with limited data compared with existing methods. This training data efficiency of our model is due to the proposed body prior. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving state-of-the-art human mesh reconstruction performance on Human3.6M~\cite{2014_H36M} and LightStage~\cite{peng2021neural} datasets.


\section{Proposed Method}
\label{sec:proposed_method}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{ssec:overview}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Fig1.pdf}
\caption{Overall structure of the proposed method. Modules containing learnable parameters are colored pink.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

We propose a method for reconstructing an SMPL-based 3D mesh~\cite{2015_SMPL} of a single person from  calibrated multi-view images. Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} illustrates the overall structure of the proposed method, which is composed of the VHA, BCP, and fitting module. In VHA, the VHA encoder first converts volumetric heatmaps  for  ground-truth subsampled vertices~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV} into the low-dimensional latent code , from which volumetric heatmaps  are reconstructed by the VHA decoder. From , the 3D coordinates of subsampled mesh vertices  are obtained through the 3D soft-argmax operation~\cite{2018_Sun, 2019_LT, Chun_2023_WACV}. The latent code  is used for training BCP, which predicts the latent code  from the  multi-view images . The predicted latent code  is fed into the VHA decoder to produce the volumetric heatmaps , from which the vertex coordinates  are computed through the 3D soft-argmax operation. Finally, the SMPL model is fitted to  by the fitting module, and the SMPL parameters corresponding to the target person are obtained.


\subsection{Vertex Heatmap Representation}
\label{ssec:heatmap_representation}

Volumetric heatmaps  are generated from the coordinates of ground-truth vertices , where  denotes the ground truth. We define a cuboid containing , with an edge length of , centered on the pelvis of the target person. We then voxelize the cuboid into a  resolution, where , , and  denote the -, -, and -axis resolutions, respectively. The process of calculating the vertex heatmap  from the -th ground-truth vertex can be written as:

where  denotes the index of the voxel containing the -th ground-truth vertex.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Fig2_edit.pdf}
\caption{The architecture of the vertex heatmap autoencoder.}
\label{fig:vha}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Vertex Heatmap Autoencoder}
\label{ssec:vha}

Fig.~\ref{fig:vha} shows the detailed structure of the VHA, which consists of a sequential combination of encoder and decoder. The VHA encoder computes the latent code  from the vertex heatmap . The VHA decoder reconstructs two vertex heatmaps  and , from the latent code . VHA consists of a combination of basic convolution block, residual block, downsample block, and  convolution block, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vha}. The basic convolution block, residual block, downsample block, and upsample block have the same structure as those in LMT~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV}.


To train the VHA,  and  are converted into vertex coordinates  and  through the 3D soft-argmax operation, respectively. Details of the 3D soft-argmax operation can be found in~\cite{2018_Sun, 2019_LT, Chun_2023_WACV}. We have empirically found that applying L1 loss not only to  but also to the intermediate mesh  helps reduce the reconstruction error of VHA. The loss function for training VHA can be written as follows:



where , , and  denote the -th row vector of , , and , respectively.




\subsection{Body Code Predictor}
\label{ssec:bcp}

We borrow the design of LMT~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV} to construct BCP. However, the output of BCP is not the vertex heatmap but the latent code unlike LMT. Therefore, we replace the vertex regression module in the LMT with the 3D CNN encoder. As a result, BCP consists of the visibility module, CNN backbone, feature aggregation module, and 3D CNN encoder. The 3D CNN encoder has the same structure as the VHA encoder. Details of the rest of the modules can be found in~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV}. 

From the input multi-view images , the visibility module first computes per-vertex visibility vectors. The obtained visibility vectors and the input images are fed into the CNN backbone to generate  2D features. The  2D features are fed into the feature aggregation module to produce a volumetric feature. The volumetric feature is converted into the latent code  through the 3D CNN encoder. We can obtain 3D human mesh vertices  by sequentially applying the pretrained VHA decoder and 3D soft-argmax to the predicted latent code .

We apply the L1 loss to the predicted latent code  to train BCP. Also, we have empirically found that applying the additional L1 loss to the vertex coordinates  can help in training BCP. The losses for training BCP can be written as:



where , , and  denote the voxel index, the number of voxels in the latent code, and the weight of the code loss, respectively. In our current implementation, .


\subsection{Fitting Module}
\label{ssec:fitting_module}

The fitting module estimates the SMPL parameters , , and  by fitting the SMPL model to  predicted by the BCP and VHA decoder. Here, , , and  denote the SMPL shape parameter, SMPL pose parameter, and global translation, respectively. In the fitting module, the SMPL mesh  is first computed from the SMPL parameters and then converted into the subsampled vertices ~\cite{COMA_ECCV18, Chun_2023_WACV}. The distance between  and  is defined as the data term . It is used as a cost function for optimization with the regularization term  that prevents unnatural poses from being generated. Details of the fitting module can be found in~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV}. The fitted mesh  obtained through optimization is used together with joint coordinates  for the final evaluation of the proposed method, where  is the pretrained joint regression matrix.










\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:experimental_results}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
\label{ssec:implementation_details}

The bounding boxes provided in the datasets are used to crop the human regions from the input images. We first train the VHA to obtain the latent code  required for training the BCP. The learning rate and mini-batch size for VHA training are set to 1e-3 and 10, respectively. The learning rate and mini-batch size for BCP training are set to 1e-4 and 3, respectively. No augmentation technique is used to train VHA and BCP. The 3D CNN encoder of BCP is initialized with the weights of the pretrained VHA encoder and then fine-tuned. We set the number of subsampled vertices , the edge length  and resolutions , ,  of the cuboid, the height  and width  of the input image, and the code loss weight  to 108, 2.0m, 64, 64, 64, 384, 384, and 100.0, respectively. We use the Adam optimizer~\cite{2015_Kingma} to train VHA and BCP for 55 and 20 epochs, which takes about 16 and 4.5 days using a single RTX 3090 GPU, respectively.


\subsection{Datasets}
\label{ssec:datasets}

We train VHA using the Human3.6M~\cite{2014_H36M} training set and AMASS~\cite{moshpp_AMASS_2019}, which are large-scale datasets. BCP is trained and evaluated on each of the Human3.6M and LightStage~\cite{peng2021neural} datasets. The AMASS sequence data are sampled every 10 frames, and the ground-truth mesh provided in the dataset is used for training. According to the Human3.6M general setting~\cite{2018_Kanazawa, 2019_LT, Chun_2023_WACV, 2020_Shin, choi2022learning}, S1, S5, S6, S7, and S8 are used as train data, and S9 and S11 are used as test data. The meshes obtained by applying MoSh~\cite{mosh_Loper_2014}, as the ground truth of Human3.6M, are used as train and test data~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV}. We use the LightStage dataset to investigate the training capability of the model on small-scale datasets. All sequences of LightStage are sampled every 5 frames and then used. About 2700 frames obtained from sequences 363-371 and 377-384 are used as train data, and about 500 frames obtained from sequences 385-388 are used as test data. We use only images obtained from cameras 1, 7, 13, and 19 among all the cameras in LightStage for training and evaluation. LightStage provides the SMPLX~\cite{SMPLify_X_2019_Pavlakos} parameters as the ground truth, not the SMPL parameters. Therefore, we use the parameter converting function~\footnote{https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx} released from~\cite{SMPLify_X_2019_Pavlakos} to convert SMPLX parameters to SMPL parameters and utilize the result as the ground truth for training and evaluation. We evaluate the joint location, joint rotation, and human mesh vertex estimation performance of the proposed method using the ground-truth mesh of each dataset through MPJPE, angular distance~\cite{Hartley_IJCV2013}, and MPVE metrics, respectively. Their units are mm, degree, and mm.

\subsection{Ablation Experiments}
\label{ssec:ablation_experiments}

The human body prior learned through VHA is utilized for mesh reconstruction by BCP in two ways: supervision of BCP using latent code and initialization of BCP weights with pretrained autoencoder weights. We perform ablation experiments to verify the effect of such a human body prior. The performances of BCPs learned and evaluated on Human3.6M train and test data are shown in Table~\ref{tab:representation_learning}. The first, second, and third columns of the table denote whether the vertex loss , code loss , and pretrained autoencoder weights are used for BCP training, respectively. According to the experimental results, the additional use of the proposed body prior improves the BCP performance compared with BCP trained by applying only vertex loss. As a result, the combination of vertex-level supervision and body prior shows the best mesh reconstruction performance.













\subsection{Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods}
\label{ssec:comparison_sota}

Table~\ref{tab:comparison_sota} compares the proposed model with existing methods for estimating SMPL parameters from calibrated multi-view images on Human3.6M and LightStage datasets. The numbers in parentheses show the evaluation results of BCP and existing models for cross-dataset generalization performance. In this experiment, models are trained on Human3.6M train data and evaluated on all train and test data of LightStage. The remaining numbers in Table~\ref{tab:comparison_sota} denote the results of the models trained and tested on each dataset.

According to the results from Human3.6M, the proposed method outperforms the existing hybrid (i.e., deep learning  optimization)~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV, 2019_LT, lightcap2021} and parameter regression~\cite{2020_Shin} approaches. This result demonstrates that using the human body prior helps train the model effectively on a large-scale dataset such as Human3.6M.

We use the small-scale LightStage dataset for training and testing to demonstrate that the proposed body prior enables the model to learn efficiently even from a limited amount of train data. The key difference between LMT and the proposed method lies in using prior knowledge in the learning-based vertex regression stage, which significantly improves the joint and vertex location estimation accuracy of the proposed model, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:comparison_sota}. Unlike the proposed method, LT-fitting estimates human joints, not human surfaces, in the learning-based regression stage. This joint location does not provide sufficient information to resolve the ambiguity of joint rotation and human shape reconstruction~\cite{Chun_2023_WACV}. As a result, the proposed method significantly outperforms LT-fitting in terms of MPVE and angular distance.

The LightStage dataset includes human poses that are excluded in Human3.6M and subjects wearing clothes that do not reveal their body shape. Therefore, achieving good reconstruction performance of the model trained in Human3.6M on LightStage requires a high generalization capability. The numbers in the parentheses in Table~\ref{tab:comparison_sota} show that using the human body prior helps model inference under this cross-dataset setting. Using a large-scale motion capture dataset including various human poses and body shapes, such as AMASS, also helps in representation learning and further improves the generalization performance of the model, which is shown in the last two rows of Table~\ref{tab:comparison_sota}.










\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study proposes autoencoder-based representation learning of volumetric heatmaps for 3D human mesh reconstruction. The proposed model (i.e., VHA) serves as an effective body prior to improve the cross-dataset generalization capability and training data efficiency of the mesh reconstruction method (i.e., BCP), achieving state-of-the-art performance. Future work will investigate whether the proposed body prior is effective for mesh reconstruction from in-the-wild images.
