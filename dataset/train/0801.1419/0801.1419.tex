\begin{abstract}
Distributed systems are now both very large and highly dynamic.
Peer to peer overlay networks have been proved efficient to cope with this new deal 
that  traditional approaches  can no  longer accommodate.  While the challenge of 
organizing
peers in an overlay network has generated a lot of interest leading to a
large number  of solutions,  maintaining  critical data  in such  a network
remains an open issue.  In this  paper, we are interested  in defining the
portion of nodes and frequency  one  has to probe, given the churn observed
in the system, in order to achieve a given  
probability of maintaining the persistence of some critical data. 
More  specifically, we provide  a clear  result relating  the size  and the
frequency of the probing set along with its proof as well as an analysis of
the  way  of leveraging   such  an information  in  a  large scale  dynamic
distributed system.

\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Context of the paper.}
Persistence of critical data in distributed applications is a crucial problem.
Although static systems have experienced many solutions, 
mostly relying
on defining the right degree  of replication, this remains  an open
issue in the context of dynamic systems. 

Recently, peer to peer (P2P) systems became popular 
as they
have been proved efficient to cope with the scale shift observed in
distributed systems.  A P2P system is a dynamic system that allow
peers (nodes) to join or leave the system. 
In the meantime, a natural tendency to trade 
strong deterministic guarantees for probabilistic ones aimed
at coping with both scale and dynamism.
Yet, quantifying bounds of guarantee that can be achieved probabilistically is 
very important for the deployment of applications. 

More  specifically, a typical issue is to ensure that despite dynamism 
some critical data is not lost.
The set of nodes owning a copy of the critical data is called a {\it core}
(distinct cores can possibly co-exist, each associated with a particular
data).   

Provided that core nodes remain long enough in the system, 
a ``data/state  transfer'' protocol can transmit the critical data from nodes to nodes.
This ensures that a new core of nodes in the system will 
keep track of the data.
Hence, such protocols provide data persistence despite the uncertainty of the system state
involved by the dynamic evolution of its members. 


There is however an inherent tradeoff in the use of such protocols.  
If the policy that is used is too  conservative, 
the data transfer protocol might be executed too often, thereby consuming
resources and increasing the whole system overhead. 
Conversely, if the protocol is executed too rarely, 
all nodes owning a copy of the data may leave (or crash) before  
a new protocol execution, and the data would be lost.
This fundamental tradeoff is the main problem addressed in 
this paper. 


\paragraph{Content of the paper.}
Considering the previous context, we are interested in providing some 
probabilistic guarantees of maintaining a \textit{core} in the system.
More precisely, given the churn observed in the system, we aim at 
maintaining the persistence of some critical data.
To this end, we are interested in defining the portion of nodes 
that must be probed, as well as the frequency to which this probe must 
occur to achieve this result with a given probability.
This boils down to relating the size and the frequency of the probing set
according to a target probability of success and the churn observed in the
system. 

The investigation of the previous tradeoff relies on  critical
parameters. One of them is naturally the size of the core. Two other parameters are the percentage of nodes that enter/leave the
system per time unit, and the duration during which we observe the system.  We first assume that, per time unit,
the number of entering nodes is the same as the number of leaving
nodes. In other words, the number of nodes remains constant.

Let  be the system at some time . It is composed of 
 nodes including a subset of  nodes defining a core  for a 
given critical data.  Let  be the system at time .
Because of the system evolution, 
some nodes owning a copy of the  critical data at time  might have
left the system at time  (those nodes are in  and not in
).  So, an important question is the following: 
``Given a set   of   nodes of ,  what is the probability that
 and  do intersect?'' We derive an explicit expression of this probability as a function of
the parameters characterizing the dynamic system.
This allows us to  compute some  of them
when other ones are fixed. 
This provides distributed 
applications with the opportunity to set a tradeoff between a probabilistic 
guarantee of achieving a core  and the overhead involved computed either 
as the number of nodes probed or the frequency at which the probing set needs
to be refreshed.

\paragraph{Related work.}
As mentioned above, P2P systems have received a great deal of
attention both in academia  
and  industry  for  the  past  five  years. More  specifically,  a  lot  of
approaches have been proposed to  
create whether they are structured,  such as Chord \cite{stoica.i2001}, CAN
\cite{ratnasamy.s2001}  or Pastry  \cite{rowstron.a2001c},  or unstructured
\cite{lpbcast,ganesh.a2003,JGKvS04}. Maintenance of such overlay networks
in the presence of high churns has also been studied as one
of the  major goal of P2P overlay networks~\cite{LBK02}.  The parameters 
impacting on connectivity and routing capabilities in P2P overlay networks  
are now well understood. 

In structured  P2P networks, routing tables contain critical information
and refreshment must occur with some frequency depending on the churn 
observed in the  network~\cite{castro2004} to achieve routing 
capabilities.
For instance in Pastry, the  size of the leaf set (set of nodes whose 
identities are numerically the closest to current node identity) and its 
maintenance protocol can be tuned to achieve the routing within reasonable  
delay stretch and low overhead.
Finally, there has been approaches evaluating the number of locations
to which a data has to be replicated
in the  system in  order to be  successfully searched by  flooding-based or
random walk-based algorithms~\cite{cohen2002}.  These approaches do 
not consider specifically churn in their analysis. 
In this paper churn is a primary concern.  The result of this work can
be applied to any P2P network, regardless of its structure, in order
to maintain critical data by refreshment at sufficiently many locations.


The use of a base core to extend protocols designed for static systems to 
dynamic systems has been investigated in \cite{MRT05}. 
Persistent cores share some features with quorums (i.e., mutually 
intersecting sets). Quorums originated a  long time 
ago  with   majority   voting  systems \cite{G79,T79}  introduced to ensure
data   consistency.   
More recently, quorum reconfiguration~\cite{LS02,CGGMS05} have been proposed to face system dynamism while 
guaranteeing atomic consistency: this application outlines the strength of
such dynamic quorums.
Quorum-based  protocols for searching  objects in  P2P
systems  are proposed in~\cite{MTK06}.  Probabilistic  quorum  systems  
have been introduced in~\cite{MRWW01}.  They use randomization to
relax the strict intersection property to a probabilistic one.  They have
been extended to dynamic systems in~\cite{AM05}. 


\paragraph{Roadmap.}
The paper is organized as follows. 
Section~\ref{sec:model}
defines the system model. Section~\ref{sec:analysis} describes
our dynamic system analysis and our probabilistic results. 
Section~\ref{sec:interpretation} interprets the
previous formulas and shows how to use them  to  control
the uncertainty of the key parameters of P2P applications.  
Finally, Section \ref{sec:discussion} concludes the paper. 


\section{System model}
\label{sec:model}
The system model, sketched in the introduction is simple. 
The system consists of  nodes. It is dynamic in the following sense. 
For the sake of simplicity, let  be the size of the system.
Every time unit,   nodes leave the system and  
nodes enter the system, where  is the percentage of nodes that enter/leave
the system per time unit; this  can be seen as  new nodes ``replacing''
leaving nodes.  Although monitoring the leave and join rates of a large-scale 
dynamic system remains an open issue, it is reasonable to assume join and leave
are tightly correlated in P2P systems. 
A more realistic model would take in account variation of the system size 
depending for instance, on night-time and day-time as observed in~\cite{SGG02}.



A node leaves the system either voluntarily or because it crashes.  
A node that leaves the system  does not enter it later.  (Practically, 
this means that, to re-enter the system, a node that has left 
must be considered as a new node; all its previous knowledge of the system 
state is lost.) 
For instance, initially (at time ), assume 
there  are  nodes  (identified  from   to
; let us take  to  simplify).  Let , which means that, 
every time unit,    node changes (a node disappears and a new 
node replaces it).  
That is, at time , one node leaves the system and another one
joins.  From now on, observe that next leaving nodes are either
nodes that were initially in the system or nodes that joined
after time .





\section{Relating the key parameters of the dynamic system}
\label{sec:analysis}

This   section answers the  question posed  in the  introduction, namely,
given a  set  of nodes  at time   (the core), 
and  a set   of  nodes at   time  , what
is the  probability  of the event ``''. 
In the remaining of this paper, we assume that both  and  
contain  nodes, since an interesting goal is to minimize both the 
number of nodes where the data is replicated and the number of nodes one has 
to probe to find the data.
Let an  {\it initial} node  be a  node that belongs  to the system  at time
.  Moreover,  without  loss   of  generality,  let    (hence,
). 

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemme-valeur-de-C}
Let  be the ratio of initial nodes that are replaced after
 time units. We have . 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proofL}
We claim that the number of initial nodes that are still in the system
after  time units is . 
The proof is by  induction on the time instants. Let us  remind that  is
the percentage of nodes that are replaced in one time unit. 
For the Base case, at  time ,    nodes have  not been
replaced. 
For the induction case, let us assume  that at time , the number of
initial nodes  that have  not been replaced is . 
Let us  consider the  time instant  .  
The number of initial nodes that are not replaced after  time units
is  , i.e.,  ,
which proves the claim. 
It follows from the previous claim that the number of initial nodes that are 
replaced during  time  units is . 
Hence, . 
\renewcommand{\toto}{lemme-valeur-de-C}
\end{proofL}


Given a  core of  nodes at  time  (each having a copy of the
critical  data), 
the following theorem  gives the probability that, at time , an 
arbitrary node cannot obtain the data when it queries  nodes arbitrarily 
chosen.  

For this purpose, using result of Lemma~\ref{lemme-valeur-de-C} we take the 
number of elements that have left the system during the period  as 
.
This number allows us to evaluate the aforementioned probability.


\begin{theorem}
	\label{theo-proba-pas-vert}
Let  be any node in the system at time . The
	probability that none of these nodes belong to the initial core is
	
	where , 
	, and 
	.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proofT}
The problem we have to solve can be represented in the following way:


	The system is an urn containing    balls (nodes), such that, 
	initially,  balls are green (they represent the initial core 
	and are represented by the set  in Figure \ref{fig-proba}),  
	while the  remaining balls are black. 
	 
	We randomly draw  balls from the urn (according to a uniform 
	distribution), and paint them  red. These  balls represent the 
	initial nodes that are replaced by new nodes after   units of time 
	(each of these balls was  initially  green or black). 
	After it has been  colored red, each of these balls is put back 
	in the urn (so, the urn contains again  balls).  
	
	We then obtain the system as described in the right part of Figure
	\ref{fig-proba}    (which   represents   the    system   state    at   time
	).  The set  is
	the set of balls that have been painted red.   is the
	core set  after  some of its balls have been painted  red
	(these  balls  represent the nodes  of the core  that have  left  the
	system). 
	This means the set , that we denote by , 
	contains all the green balls and only them.
	
	We denote by  the number of balls in the set .
	It is well-known that  has a hypergeometric distribution, i.e., 
	for  where  and ,
	we have

	

	We finally draw randomly and successively  balls  from the urn (system at time )
	without replacing them.
	The problem consists in computing the probability of the event
	\{none of the selected balls  are green\}, which can be written as 
	.

\section{From formulas to parameter tuning}
\label{sec:interpretation}

In the  previous section, we  have provided a  set of formulas that  can be
leveraged   and    exploited   by   distributed    applications   in   many
ways. Typically,  in a  P2P system,  the churn rate  is not  negotiated but
observed\footnote{Monitoring the churn  rate of  a system,  although very
interesting, is   out  of  the   scope  of  this   paper.}.  Nevertheless,
applications deployed on P2P overlays  
 may   need  to  choose   the  probabilistic   guarantees  
 that a node of the initial core is probed.
Given such a probability, the application 
may fix  either  the  size of the probing set of  nodes or  the
frequency at  which the core  needs  to be re-established from the current
set of nodes (with the  help  of an appropriate data transfer protocol). 


This section  exploits  the previous  formula  to relate  these
various elements. More precisely, we 
provide the various  relations existing between the three  factors that can
be tuned by an application designer: 
the size of the probing set  , the frequency of the probing , and
the probability of achieving a core characterized by .
(For the sake of clarity all along this section, a ratio , or  ,
is sometimes expressed as a  percentage.  
Floating point numbers on the -axis are represented in 
their mantissa and exponent numbers.)


\paragraph{Relation linking  and .}

The first parameter that we formalized is , that can be interpreted as
 the rate of dynamism in the system.  
 depends  both  on the churn rate  () observed in the  system and the
 probing frequency  ().
More specifically, we foresee here a scenario in which an application designer
would consider tolerating a churn  in order to define 
the  size of   a core  and  thus ensure  the persistence  of some  critical
data. For example, an application may need to tolerate a churn rate of 10\%
in the system, meaning that the persistence of some critical data should be
ensured as  long as  up to  10\% of the  nodes in  the system  change  over
time.  Therefore, depending  on the  churn  observed and  monitored in  the
system, we are able to  define  the longest period  before which the
core  should be re-instantiated on a set of the current nodes.  One of  the
main   interest of  linking     and    is  that if    varies
over time,    can  be  adapted   accordingly without  compromising
the  initial requirements of the application.  

More formally, Lemma   \ref{lemme-valeur-de-C}  provides  an explicit value
of     (the  ratio   of  initial   nodes   that   are  replaced)   as  a
function  of    (the replacement ratio per time  unit) and  (the
number  of time  units).  Figure  \ref{courbes-c-et-delta}  represents this
function  for several  values of  . More  explicitly, it   depicts  on a
logarithmic  scale the curve  (or equivalently, the
curve  ).  
As an example, the  curve associated with   indicates that  
of the initial nodes have been replaced after   time
units (point A, Figure \ref{courbes-c-et-delta}), when the replacement ratio 
is  per time unit. 
Similarly, the same replacement ratio per time unit entails the replacement 
of    of  the  initial  nodes  when  the  duration  we  consider  is
  time  units (point B, Figure \ref{courbes-c-et-delta}).  
The system designer can benefit from these values to 
better appreciate the way the system evolves according to the assumed
replacement ratio per time unit.
To summarize, this result can be used as follows. In a system, 
aiming at tolerating a churn of \% of the nodes, our goal is to
provide an application with  the corresponding value of , 
knowing the churn    observed in the system.  This gives the opportunity
to adjust   if    changes over time.

\paragraph{Relation linking  the core size  and }


Now, given  a value  set by  an application developer, there are still 
two parameters that may influence either the overhead of maintaining a core
in the  system, or the  probabilistic guarantee of  having such a  core. The
overhead may be measured in a straightforward manner in this context as the
number of  nodes that  need to  be probed, namely  . Intuitively,  for a
given  , as   increases,  the probability  of probing  a node  of the
initial core  increases. In this section, we define how much 
these parameters are related.



Let us consider the value  determined by Theorem 
\ref{theo-proba-pas-vert}. That value can be interpreted the following way:
  is the probability 
that, at time , one of the  queries 
issued (randomly) by a node hits a node of the core. 
An important question is  then the following: How are  and 
related? Or equivalently, how increasing the size of  enable to decrease
?  
This  relation is depicted in  Figure \ref{courbes-eps-et-q}(a) where
several curves are represented for  nodes. 


Each curve corresponds to a percentage of the initial nodes that have 
been replaced. (As an example, the  curve  corresponds  to the case
where   of  the initial nodes have left the system; 
the way ,  and  are related has been seen previously.) 
Let us consider . The curves show that  is
a sufficient core  size for not bypassing that value  of  when up
to  of the nodes  are replaced (point A, Figure~\ref{courbes-eps-et-q}(a)). 
Differently,    is  not sufficient when up to    of the  nodes
are  replaced;   in that   case, the  size    is required  (point B,
Figure~\ref{courbes-eps-et-q}(a)).   


The curves of both Figure \ref{courbes-c-et-delta} and Figure~\ref{courbes-eps-et-q}(a) 
provide the system designer with realistic hints
to set the value of  (deadline before which a data transfer
protocol establishing a new core has to be executed). 
Figure~\ref{courbes-eps-et-q}(b) is  a zoom of Figure~\ref{courbes-eps-et-q}(a) focusing on the small values of  .  
It shows that, when , the probability 
 increases very rapidly towards 1, though the size of the 
core increases only very slightly.   As an   example, let   us
consider  the  curve associated with  in  
Figure \ref{courbes-eps-et-q}(b). It shows that a
core of  nodes ensures an intersection probability~,
and  a   core   of    nodes  ensures   an  intersection  probability
.

Interestingly,  this phenomenon  is similar to the {\it birthday
paradox}\footnote{The  paradox  is  with  respect  to  intuition,  not  with
respect to logics.} \cite{I95} that can be roughly summarized as follows.  
How many persons must be present in a room for two of them
to have the same birthday with probability ? 
Actually, for  that probability to  be greater than , it is sufficient
that the number of persons in the room  be equal (only) to  ! 
When, there are  persons  in the  room, the probability becomes ,
and  increases to  for  persons. 
In  our  case, we observe a similar phenomenon: 
the  probability   increases  very rapidly despite the fact
that  the frequency of the core size  increases slightly.


In our case, this means that  the system designer 
can choose to slightly increase the size of the probing set  (and 
therefore  only slightly increase the associated overhead)
while significantly increasing the probability to access a node of the core.



\paragraph{Relation linking  and }

So far, we have considered that an application may need to fix  and 
then define the size of the probing set to achieve a given probability  of 
success. There is another remaining trade-off that an application designer
might want to decide upon:  trading the size of the probing set with the
probing frequency while fixing the probability 
of intersecting the initial core. This is precisely defined by relating 
 to  for a fixed .

In the following we investigate the way the size and lifetime of the core
are related when the required intersection probability is 
 or  .  We chose these values to better illustrate our purpose,
as we believe they reflect what could be expected by an application
designer.  For both  probabilities we present two different figures summarizing
the required  values of  .

\caption{The core size depending on the system sizes and the churn rate.}
 \label{fig:tabular}
\end{figure} 


Figure~\ref{fig:tabular} focuses on  the core size that is required in a static
system and in a dynamic system (according to various values of the ratio ).  
The static system implies that no nodes leave or join the system while
the dynamic system contains nodes that join and leave the system depending on
several churn values.
For the sake of clarity we omit values of  and 
simply present  taking several values from  to .
The analysis of the results depicted in the figure leads to two interesting 
observations.

First, when  is big enough for  of the system 
nodes to be replaced,  then the core size required is
amazingly close to the static case 
(873 versus 828 when  and the probability is ).
Moreover,  has to be equal to  only when  increases up to . 
Second, even when  is sufficiently large to let  
of the system nodes be replaced, the minimal number of nodes
to probe remains low with respect to the system size.  For instance, 
if  is sufficiently large to let  nodes be
replaced in a system with  nodes, then only 413 nodes  must be 
randomly probed to obtain an intersection with probability .


To conclude, these results clearly show that a critical data
in a highly dynamic system can persist in a scalable way: 
even though the delay between core re-establishments is reasonably 
large while the  size  of the  core remains  relatively low. 



\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Maintenance of critical data in large-scale dynamic systems where nodes 
may join and leave dynamically is a critical issue. In this paper, 
we define the notion of persistent core of nodes that can
maintain such critical data  with a high probability regardless of 
the structure of the underlying P2P network.  
More specifically, we relate
the parameters that can be tuned to achieve a high probability of 
defining a core, namely the size of the core, the
frequency at which it has to be re-established, and the churn rate 
of the system.

Our results provide application designers with a set of guidelines 
to tune the system
parameters depending on the expected guarantees and the churn rate variation.
An interesting outcome of this paper is
to 
show that slightly increasing the size of the core result in a significant 
probability increase of the guarantee. 

This work opens up a number of very interesting research directions. 
An interesting question
is related to the design and evaluation of efficient probing protocols, defining such a core in the system
applicable to a large spectrum of peer to peer overlay networks.  
Monitoring the system 
in order to estimate the churn rate is another interesting issue.
