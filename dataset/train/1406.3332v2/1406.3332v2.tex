The convolutional multilayer kernel is a generalization of the hierarchical kernel
descriptors introduced in computer vision~\cite{bo2011,bo2010}. The kernel produces a
sequence of image representations that are built on top of each other in a
multilayer fashion. Each layer can be interpreted as a non-linear
transformation of the previous one with additional spatial invariance. We call these
layers \emph{image feature maps}\footnote{In the kernel literature, ``feature map'' denotes the mapping between data points and their representation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)~\cite{shawe2004}. Here, feature maps refer to spatial maps representing local image characteristics at everly location, as usual in the neural network literature~\cite{lecun1998}.}, and formally define them as follows:
\begin{definition}
   An image feature map~ is a function~, where~ is a (usually discrete) subset of~
   representing normalized ``coordinates'' in the image and~ is a Hilbert space.
\end{definition}
For all practical examples in this paper,  is a two-dimensional grid
and corresponds to different locations in a two-dimensional image. In other
words,  is a set of pixel coordinates. Given~ in~, the
point~ represents some characteristics of the image at
location~, or in a neighborhood of~.
For instance, a color image of size~ with three
channels, red, green, and blue, may be represented by an initial feature
map~, where~ is an~ regular grid,  is the Euclidean space , and 
provides the color pixel values. With the multilayer scheme, non-trivial feature maps will be
obtained subsequently, which will encode more complex image characteristics.
With this terminology in hand, we now introduce the convolutional kernel, first, for a single layer.

\begin{definition}[\bfseries Convolutional Kernel with Single Layer] \label{def:scattering}
   Let us consider two images represented by two
   image feature maps, respectively~ and~,
   where~ is a set of pixel locations, and~ is a Hilbert space.
   The one-layer convolutional kernel between~ and~ is defined as 
  
  where~ and~ are smoothing parameters of Gaussian kernels,
  and~ if~ and~ otherwise.
  Similarly,  is a normalized version of~.\footnote{When~ is not discrete, the notation~ in~(\ref{eq:kernel}) should be replaced by the Lebesgue integral~ in the paper.}
\end{definition}
\vspace*{-0.1cm}
It is easy to show that the kernel~ is positive definite (see Appendix~A). It consists of a sum of pairwise
comparisons between the image features~ and~ computed at
all spatial locations~ and~ in~. To be significant in the sum, a
comparison needs the corresponding  and~ to be close 
in~, and the normalized features  and
 to be close in the feature space~. 
The parameters~ and~ respectively control these two definitions
of ``closeness''. Indeed, when~
is large, the kernel~ is invariant to the positions~ and~ but
when~ is small, only features placed at the same location  are
compared to each other. Therefore, the role of~ is to control how much the kernel
is locally shift-invariant. Next, we will show how to go beyond one single
layer, but before that, we present concrete examples of simple input
feature maps~.
\vs
\paragraph{Gradient map.} Assume that  and that
 provides the two-dimensional gradient of the image at
pixel~, which is often computed with first-order differences along each
dimension. Then, the quantity  is the gradient intensity, and~ is its orientation,
which can be characterized by a particular angle---that is, there exists~
in~ such that . The
resulting kernel~ is exactly the kernel descriptor introduced in
\cite{bo2011,bo2010} for natural image patches.

\vs
\paragraph{Patch map.} In that setting,  associates to a
location~ an image patch of size~ centered at~.
Then, the space~ is simply~, and~ is a \emph{contrast-normalized}
version of the patch, which is a useful transformation for visual recognition according
to classical findings in computer vision~\cite{jarrett2009}. When the
image is encoded with three color channels, patches are of size~.

We now define the multilayer convolutional kernel,
generalizing some ideas of~\cite{bo2011}.

\begin{definition}[\bfseries Multilayer Convolutional Kernel]\label{def:multiscattering}
   Let us consider a set  and a Hilbert space .
   We build a new set~ and a new Hilbert space~ as follows:

   (i) choose a patch shape~ defined as a bounded symmetric subset
   of~, and a set of coordinates~
   such that for all location~ in~, the patch~ is a subset of~;\footnote{For two sets~
   and~, the Minkowski sum  is defined as .\label{foot:minkowski}}
   In other words, each coordinate~ in~ corresponds to a valid patch in~ centered at~.

   (ii) define the convolutional kernel~ on the ``patch'' feature maps~, by replacing in~(\ref{eq:kernel}):~ by~,~
   by~, and~ by appropriate smoothing
   parameters~. We denote by~ the Hilbert space for
   which the positive definite kernel~ is reproducing.

   An image represented by a feature map~ at layer~ is now encoded in the~-th layer as~, where for all~ in~,~ is the representation
   in~ of the patch feature map~ for~ in~.
\end{definition}
Concretely, the kernel~ between two patches of~ and~ at respective locations~ and~~is
\vspace*{-0.1cm}

where~ is the Hilbertian norm of~.
In Figure~\ref{subfig:hierarchy}, we illustrate the interactions
between the sets of coordinates~, patches~, and feature spaces~ across
layers. For two-dimensional grids, a typical patch
shape is a square, for example~ for a  patch in an image of size~. Information encoded in the~-th layer differs from the~-th one in two aspects:
first, each point~ in layer~ contains
information about several points from the -th layer and can possibly represent
larger patterns; second, the new feature map is more locally shift-invariant than the previous one due to the
term involving the parameter~ in~(\ref{eq:kernelpatch}).

The multilayer convolutional kernel slightly differs from the hierarchical kernel descriptors
of~\cite{bo2011} but exploits similar ideas. Bo et al.~\cite{bo2011} define
indeed several ad hoc kernels for representing local information in images,
such as gradient, color, or shape. These kernels are close to the one
defined in~(\ref{eq:kernel}) but with a few variations. Some of them do not
use normalized features~, and these kernels use different
weighting strategies for the summands of~(\ref{eq:kernel}) that are specialized
to the image modality, \eg, color, or gradient, whereas we use the same
weight~ for all kernels. The generic
formulation~(\ref{eq:kernel}) that we propose may be useful per
se, but our main contribution comes in the next section, where we use the  
kernel as a new tool for learning convolutional neural networks.
