\begin{abstract}
We present an effective method to progressively integrate and refine the cross-modality complementarities for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD).
The proposed network mainly solves two challenging issues: 1) how to effectively integrate the complementary information from RGB image and its corresponding depth map, and 2) how to adaptively select more saliency-related features.
\textit{First}, we propose a cross-modality feature modulation (cmFM) module  to enhance feature representations by taking the depth features as prior, which models the complementary relations of RGB-D data.
\textit{Second}, we propose an adaptive feature selection (AFS)  module to  select saliency-related features and suppress the inferior ones. The AFS module exploits multi-modality spatial feature fusion with the self-modality and cross-modality interdependencies of channel features are considered.
\textit{Third}, we employ a saliency-guided position-edge attention (sg-PEA) module to encourage our network to focus more on saliency-related regions.
The above modules as a whole, called cmMS block, facilitates the refinement of saliency features in a coarse-to-fine fashion.
Coupled with a bottom-up inference, the refined saliency features enable accurate and edge-preserving SOD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art saliency detectors on six popular RGB-D SOD benchmarks.

\section{Introduction}

Depth maps provide useful cues such as depth of field, shape, and boundary to complement RGB images for SOD \cite{PCFN,TAN,MMCI,DMRA,A2dele,CPFP}.
However, depth maps are inherently noisy and the cues provided can be inconsistent or misaligned with the RGB modality.
The issues make designing an RGB-D algorithm challenging. Contemporary RGB-D SOD detectors, CPFP \cite{CPFP} (Fig.~\ref{fig:example}(d)) and A2dele \cite{A2dele} (Fig.~\ref{fig:example}(e)), could still miss salient objects due to cluttered backgrounds or yield incomplete or serrated boundaries of saliency maps.

	\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

In this work, we consider addressing the aforementioned problem through more careful investigation on the integration of cross-modality complementaries from RGB image and depth map as well as the selection of saliency-related features.
To this end, we present an effective network that achieves complete, sharp, and edge-preserving saliency detection, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:example}(f).

First, we propose a cross-modality feature modulation (cmFM) module that  enhances RGB feature representations by taking the corresponding depth features as prior.
This is in contrast to popular strategies that perform either input fusion \cite{Peng2014}, early fusion \cite{DSS}, or late fusion \cite{CTMF}, that crudely concatenate or add the multi-modality information.
The proposed modulation design enables effective integration of multi-modality information through feature transformation, distinctly models the inseparable cross-modality relations, and reduces the interference caused by the inherent inconsistency of multi-modality data.

Second, we devise an adaptive feature selection (AFS) module that highlights the importance of different channel features in self- and cross-modalities, while fusing multi-modality spatial features in a gated manner.
This is different from previous RGB-D SOD algorithms \cite{PCFN,TAN,DCFF,MMCI,ASIF-Net,CPFP} that treat channel features from different modalities equally and independently.
Relaxing such assumptions allows our method to adaptively select more saliency-related features and suppress the inferior ones from both spatial features and channel features. It also mitigates the negative influence of poorly captured depth maps.
Hence, our network equips additional flexibility in dealing with different information.
We also emphasize the saliency-related positions and edges by introducing a saliency-guided position-edge attention (sg-PEA) module, which collects its attention weights from the predicted saliency maps and saliency edge maps.


Our method is unique in that the feature modulation and attention mechanism are closely coupled in a coarse-to-fine manner.
Specifically, fusion is first performed by the cmFM module to provide rich features representations. Coordinated with our AFS module, saliency-related features are emphasized while redundant features are suppressed. The saliency-related features are further refined by the sg-PEA module. A careful design to place the cmFM, AFS, and sg-PEA modules allows the cross-modality complementarities to go through modulation, selection, and refinement in a coarse-to-fine fashion, providing our network with precise saliency features.  Coupled with a bottom-up inference, the precise saliency features enable us to perform more accurate and robust SOD.


\noindent\textbf{Contributions}. We present an effective approach for RGB-D SOD. Cross-modality complementarities are effectively integrated and saliency-related features are adaptively selected. This is made possible by designing a coarse-to-fine fusion that consists of 1) a cross-modality feature modulation module that enhances RGB feature representations by taking the corresponding depth features as prior, and 2) an adaptive feature selection module that progressively emphasizes the importance of channel features in self- and cross-modalities while fusing the significant multi-modality spatial features.
Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SOD methods on six popular RGB-D SOD benchmarks.



\section{Related Work}


\noindent
\textbf{Salient Object Detection.} SOD methods range from bottom-up \cite{DSR,SMD,RCRR} to top-down models \cite{AFNet,Guan2018,DSS,PoolNet,BASNet,EGNet}.
In addition to the color appearance, depth maps can provide useful cues such as depth of field, shape, and boundary.
The depth map is implicitly used in the unsupervised methods \cite{crm2019tc,DCMC,ACSD,Niu2012,Peng2014,Song2017,Zhu2018}. Whereas for the supervised methods, the discriminative and complementary features are learned from RGB-D images \cite{PCFN,TAN,DCFF,MMCI,fan2020bbs,Fu2020JLDCF,CTMF,ASIF-Net,DMRA,DF,Zhang2020CVPR,Zhangmiao2020CVPR,CPFP}.
Our work differs from recent works \cite{fan2020bbs,Fu2020JLDCF,DMRA,A2dele,Zhang2020CVPR,Zhangmiao2020CVPR,CPFP}, mainly in two aspects: 1) we use depth features as prior to learn optimal affine transformation parameters, which can flexibly modulate multi-level RGB features, and 2) we consider both self-modality and cross-modality channel features as well as multi-modality spatial features, thus effectively capturing relations among different modalities.


\noindent
\textbf{Feature Modulation.}
Inspired by FiLM \cite{FiLM} that first applies linear feature modulation for visual reasoning, feature modulation has been used in few-shot learning \cite{TADAM} and image super-resolution \cite{SR2018}.
In our studies, we modulate the multi-level feature representations conditioned on the corresponding depth features. Besides, we design the cross-modality feature modulation in a pixel-wise manner, which provides elaborate and fine-grained control to the features.





\noindent
\textbf{Attention Mechanism.}
Attention mechanism is increasingly applied in diverse forms such as spatial attention \cite{Spattention}, dual-attention \cite{DualAttention}, self-attention  \cite{Attention17}, multi-level attention \cite{MultiAttention}, and channel attention \cite{ChannelAttention}.
In contrast, we employ the attention mechanism in our adaptive feature selection module, which explores the interdependencies of channel features in the self- and cross-modalities while fusing the significant multi-modality spatial features in a gated manner.





\section{Our Method}
We first present an overview of our network architecture. Then, we describe the key components including the cross-modality feature modulation module, adaptive feature selection module, and saliency-guided position-edge attention module. At last, we introduce the loss functions.


\subsection{Overview of Network Architecture }

\begin{figure*}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.98\textwidth]{framework.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{Overview of our network architecture}. The inputs are the RGB image and its depth map. The cmMS block consists of a cmFM module, an AFS module, and an sg-PEA module. Here, the sg-PEA module further contains an S-Pre unit and an E-Pre unit. `Conv n' represents the convolutional layer that outputs  feature maps, where  is the half number of input feature maps.  `A', `M', and `C' represent element-wise addition, element-wise multiplication, and concatenation along with the channel dimension, respectively. `Up' represents the up-sampling block.

We treat  as the final result.}
	\label{framework}
\end{figure*}

The overview of our network architecture is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{framework}.
After the top-down features extraction from VGG-16 backbone \cite{VGG},
the multi-level RGB features and depth features are fed to a convolutional layer for halving the number of feature maps, respectively. Then, the dimension reduced RGB-D features are forwarded to the corresponding cmMS block. In each cmMS block, the RGB-D features go through cmFM module, AFS module, and sg-PEA module for feature modulation, selection, and refinement, respectively.
Specifically, we introduce modulated features by using our proposed cross-modality feature modulation (cmFM) module. The purpose of cmFM module is to effectively integrate the cross-modality complementarities in a flexible and trainable fashion.
After that, RGB features, depth features, modulated features, and  up-sampled features from the higher level (if any) are independently forwarded to our proposed adaptive feature selection (AFS) module for selectively emphasizing the informative channel features and fusing the significant spatial features. The AFS module models the relations between different levels and accelerates task-oriented feature integration.
Meanwhile, the concatenation of RGB features, depth features, modulated features, and up-sampled features (if any) is applied to predict the saliency edge map via a saliency edge prediction (E-Pre) unit.
Then, with the saliency map up-sampled from the higher level (if any) and saliency edge map, we highlight the saliency position and edge regions of the features after the AFS module.  After that, we predict the saliency map in the current level via a saliency map prediction (S-Pre) unit by using the refined features.
At last,  in the bottom-up inference, we progressively integrate and highlight multi-level features to predict the fine-scaled saliency map (\ie, the  in Fig.~\ref{framework}).
We adopt 33  kernels for all convolutional layers in our network, except the cmFM module that employs the multi-scale convolutions to enlarge receptive field.



\subsection{Cross-modality Feature Modulation (cmFM)}
Inspired by the unsupervised RGB-D SOD algorithms \cite{DCMC,LBE}  which take the depth map as prior information to enrich the saliency cues, we propose a cmFM module conditioned on the depth features. The cmFM module learns pixel-wise affine transformation parameters from the conditioning depth features then modulates the corresponding RGB feature representations in each level of our network. The detailed cmFM module is illustrated in Fig. \ref{cmFM}.


\begin{figure*}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=11cm,height=3.7cm]{cmFM.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{The proposed cmFM module}. For the estimation of both   and , the kernels of convolutional layers are 77, 55, 33, and 33. The feature extractor represents VGG-16 backbone. The feature maps are illustrated as heatmaps.}
	\label{cmFM}
\end{figure*}


Given the dimension halved RGB features  
 and depth features   ,  the cmFM module learns a mapping function  conditioned on the depth features to yield a set of affine transformation parameters (,) 
. Here,  is the number of feature maps;  and  are the height and width of the feature maps, respectively. It can be expressed as:

where the superscript indicates the modality while the subscript represents the level.  The mapping function  is built on two parallel stacked convolutional layers as shown in Fig. \ref{cmFM}.
With the estimated affine transformation parameters (,), we conduct pixel-wise scaling and shifting on the RGB feature representations, which can be expressed as:

where  represent the modulated features;  and  indicate the element-wise multiplication and element-wise addition, respectively. As shown in Fig. \ref{cmFM}, the cluttered backgrounds of RGB features become clear and the salient object is highlighted with the modulation of depth features.

\subsection{Adaptive Feature Selection (AFS)}

To make our network focus more on informative features, we propose an AFS module to progressively re-scale channel-wise features. Simultaneously, the AFS module fuses significant spatial features of multi-modalities. To be specific, we first explore the interdependencies of channel features in the self-modality, then further determine the relevance in the cross-modality. After squeezing by a convolutional layer that reduces the redundant features, we achieve the channel attention-on-channel attention features.  Such a self-modality and cross-modality channel attention mechanism can model relations of the channel features among different modalities well and adaptively select the informative channel features. The advantages of our channel attention-on-channel attention than the conventional channel attention are verified in the ablation studies.

We simultaneously fuse the multi-modality features to achieve the enhanced feature representations based on a gated spatial fusion mechanism, where the pixel-wise confidence map for each input feature is calculated. In this way, the significant multi-modality spatial features are preserved. As a result, we achieve saliency-related features and filter out irrelevant or misleading features from both  spatial and channel aspects. The detail of AFS module is shown in Fig. \ref{CA-on-CA}.

\begin{figure*}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.92\textwidth]{CA-on-CA.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{The detail of AFS module}. `Cat' represents the concatenation operation. `SE-Net' is the squeeze-and-excitation network.}
	\label{CA-on-CA}
\end{figure*}


Given the features (, , , ), we first perform global average pooling on each set of features separately, leading to a channel descriptor  for each one, which is an embedded global distribution of channel-wise feature responses.  indicate 2 up-sampled features from the +1 level by using the `Up' block that consists of one 2 linear interpolation followed by two convolutional layers, where each convolutional layer is followed by the ReLU activation and outputs  feature maps. The -th entry of  is expressed as:

where . Then, a self-gating mechanism is used to fully capture channel-wise dependencies :

where  represents the Sigmoid activation,   represents the ReLU activation,  denotes the convolution operation, and  and  are the weights of two fully-connected layers with their numbers of output channels being  and , respectively. At last, these weights are applied to each set of input features  to generate re-scaled features   : .
This processing is mathematically expressed as an  mapping function in this paper and  can also be implemented by the squeeze-and-excitation network \cite{ChannelAtt}. However, the highlighted channel features may become relatively useless among all channel attention results from multi-modalities.

To emphasize the informative channel features, we first halve the number of feature maps in each channel attention result by a convolutional layer, then concatenate them: .
After that, we further explore the interdependencies of channel features by .
We finally squeeze the number of channel features by a convolutional layer and achieve the results of channel attention-on-channel attention  .

Meanwhile, we fuse the multi-modality input features to achieve enhanced spatial feature representations.
First, the input features are concatenated , and fed to a plain CNN network (indicated as ) to estimate their pixel-wise confidence maps:

where , , , and    represent the confidence maps. The  is built on six stacked convolutional layers as shown in Fig. \ref{CA-on-CA}. The achieved features in the level  can be expressed as:

Then, we pass these features to a convolutional layer and achieve the gated fusion features . At last, we combine the enhanced spatial feature representations with the enhanced channel feature representations by:

where the final results  enjoy the most informative features towards saliency detection, called saliency-related features in this paper. The visual examples are presented in Fig. \ref{Feature_map}. As shown, the saliency-related spatial features and channel features are preserved and highlighted.

\begin{figure*}[!t]

	\includegraphics[width=12cm,height=1.8cm]{ca-on-ca_features.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{Visual results of the intermediate features in our AFS module}. `CA-on-CA Features' indicates the features after our channel selection while `Gated Fusion Features' represents the features after our spatial selection.}
	\label{Feature_map}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Saliency-Guided Position-Edge Attention (sg-PEA)}
After selecting the saliency-related features, we also encourage the network to focus on those positions and edges most essential to the nature of salient objects. The benefits are illustrated as follows:
1) the saliency position attention can better locate the salient objects and accelerate the network convergence, and 2) the saliency edge attention can alleviate the problem of edge blur caused by the repeated pooling operations, which is vital for the pixel-wise saliency prediction.

To the end, we propose a saliency-guided position-edge attention (sg-PEA) module to  locate and sharpen salient objects. The sg-PEA module further includes a saliency map prediction  (S-Pre) unit and a saliency edge prediction (E-Pre) unit as shown in Fig. \ref{framework}. The details are provided in Fig. \ref{PEA}, where  S-Pre unit and E-Pre unit share the same structure, but different weights.


\noindent
\textbf{Position Attention.} We employ the up-sampled saliency map from the higher level as the attention weights. Here, the up-sampling is implemented by the simple 2 linear interpolation. In our method, the saliency map is predicted by the S-Pre unit in each level in a supervised learning manner.
The benefits of such a side supervision manner lie in four aspects: 1) the convolutional layers in each level have explicit objective towards saliency detection, 2) the side supervision can accelerate gradient back-propagation, 3) the predicted saliency map works as a guidance and can steer the convolutional layers of lower level to focus more on saliency positions in a low-computational manner, and 4) the multiple side outputs can provide diverse choices based on accuracy and inference speed. We provide more analysis on the side outputs in the supplementary material.

To be specific, with the saliency-related features  and the up-sampled saliency map , the position attention results  can be expressed as:

In contrast to treating all positions of saliency features equally, the position attention can quickly and efficiently employ the saliency property of higher level and enhance the  saliency representations of the current level. To avoid gradient diffusion induced by successive attention (the values of feature maps are close to zero), we adopt an identical mapping manner as shown in Eq. \eqref{equ_11}.

\begin{figure*}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=12cm,height=3cm]{position-edge.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{Visual results of sg-PEA module}. Left panel shows the structure of S-Pre/E-Pre unit, and the predicted saliency maps and saliency edge maps in different levels. Right panel shows the intermediate features before and after the sg-PEA module. After the sg-PEA module, the background of features are suppressed, and the edge and position details are assigned more focuses. }
	\label{PEA}
\end{figure*}

\noindent
\textbf{Edge Attention.}
To obtain the edge attention weights, we first concatenate the RGB-D features, the modulated features, and up-sampled features, then forward them to the E-Pre unit to predict the saliency edge map in each level. The saliency edge maps, also estimated by supervised learning, can be used to emphasize the salient edges of the features by simple element-wise multiplication. For level , the output features of edge attention can be expressed as:

where  is the predicted saliency edge map in the level . We call  as the refined features. At last, with the refined features, the  final result (\ie, )  with the same size as the input RGB image can be achieved in a bottom-up manner. In Fig. \ref{PEA}, we present the changes of features before and after sg-PEA module. As shown, the features increasingly focus on the saliency position and edge details, while the cluttered backgrounds are concurrently reduced.


\subsection{Loss Function}
We employ the standard cross-entropy (SCE) loss \cite{cross-entropy} to  jointly optimize our network for the saliency prediction and saliency edge prediction:

where  indicates the level,  and  represent the losses for predicting the saliency map and saliency edge map in the level , respectively.  and  are the corresponding weights.




\section{Experiments}\label{er}
\subsection{Benchmark Datasets and Evaluation Metrics}

We conduct experiments on six popular RGB-D SOD datasets, including \textbf{NJUD} \cite{ACSD} (1985 RGB-D images), \textbf{NLPR} \cite{Peng2014} (1000 RGB-D images), \textbf{STEREO} \cite{Niu2012} (797 RGB-D images), \textbf{LFSD} \cite{LFSD} (100 RGB-D images), \textbf{SSD} \cite{SSD} (80 RGB-D images), and \textbf{DUT} \cite{DMRA} (1200 RGB-D images).
For quantitative evaluations, Precision-Recall (P-R) curve,  F-measure \cite{Fmeasure}, MAE score \cite{RERVIEW}, and S-measure \cite{S-measure} are employed. P-R curve depicts the different combinations of precision and recall scores; the closer the P-R curve is to (1,1), the better the performance of the method. F-measure is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall; it is a comprehensive measurement, with a larger value indicating a better performance. MAE score measures the difference between the continuous saliency map and ground truth; a smaller value indicates a smaller gap hence better. S-measure  calculates the structural similarity between the saliency map and ground truth; a larger value indicates a better performance. Additionally, we compare the model sizes of different methods in the supplementary material.


\subsection{Implementation Details}
We adopt the same training, validation, and testing sets as described in \cite{DMRA,A2dele}. The ground truth of saliency edge map prediction is obtained by using the Canny edge detector on the saliency mask. We implement our network with TensorFlow on a PC with an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU. During training, the batch size is set to 4, the filter weights of each layer are initialized by Gaussian distribution, and the bias is initialized as a constant. We use ADAM and fix the learning rate to . The weight  for predicting the final saliency map is set to 1.2 while other weights are set to 1 in Eq. \eqref{equ_13}. For a pair of RGB-D images of size 224224, the average runtime of our method is 0.037s on the aforementioned PC.



\subsection{Comparisons with State-of-the-art Methods}
We compare our method with 12 state-of-the-art learning-based SOD methods, including two latest RGB-induced SOD methods (\ie, PoolNet \cite{PoolNet} and EGNet \cite{EGNet}), and ten RGB-D SOD methods (\ie, DF \cite{DF}, CTMF \cite{CTMF}, MMCI \cite{MMCI}, PCFN \cite{PCFN}, TAN \cite{TAN}, CPFP \cite{CPFP}, DCFF \cite{DCFF}, DMRA \cite{DMRA}, ASIF-Net \cite{ASIF-Net}, and A2dele \cite{A2dele}).

	\label{PR}
\end{figure*}

Visual comparisons are shown in Fig. \ref{visual}. Our method achieves more competitive performance than the compared methods.
\textbf{First}, the salient objects in our results are more complete and accurate, and the object boundaries are sharper. In the first image, only our method can accurately and completely detect the salient toy in front, while the competing methods incorrectly reserve the background regions (\eg, Android doll and checkerboard). In the fourth image that comes with an unsatisfactory depth map, our method can still accurately locate salient target with a complete structure and clear boundaries.
\textbf{Second}, our method preserves more details in the saliency result. In the sixth image, more details of plant leaves are better conserved.
\textbf{Third}, our method can address some challenging cases, such as a complex background and small object. In the third image, the cat dolls in the back row are successfully suppressed by our method, the detected salient boundaries are sharper, and the structure is more complete. In the fifth image illustrating a case of complex background, our method can still completely detect a small salient object (\ie, the human).

The P-R curves of different methods are shown in Fig. \ref{PR}. Our method (\ie, the red solid line) achieves the highest precision compared to other methods on all datasets. The numerical results are reported in Table \ref{num1}. Our method achieves the best quantitative results across all metrics, outperforming all competing methods.  Compared with the \textbf{second best method} on the NJUD-Test dataset, the percentage gain reaches  for F-measure,  for MAE score, and  for S-measure. On the DUT-test dataset, the \textbf{minimum percentage gain} reaches  for F-measure,  for MAE score, and  for S-measure. All these measures demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method.

\subsection{Ablation Studies}


To verify the impact of our key modules, we conduct experiments on the STEREO dataset and DUT-Test dataset. The quantitative results are shown in Table \ref{num3}. An example of visual comparison is illustrated in Fig. \ref{ablation_results}.


\noindent
\textbf{Cross-Modality Feature Modulation (cmFM).} We compare three variants: \textit{w/o cmFM}, \textit{w/ cmFA}, and \textit{w/ cmFC}. In Fig. \ref{ablation_results}, the baseline  \textit{w/o cmFM} cannot effectively detect the salient object while the baselines \textit{w/ cmFA} and \textit{w/ cmFC} achieve the similar detection result. The same quantitative trend also reflects in  Table \ref{num3}. Compared with the full model, the results indicate that the proposed cmFM module is important for improving the SOD performance. Besides, the simple addition and concatenation can only boost a little performance.

\noindent
\textbf{Adaptive Feature Selection (AFS).}
We compare with four baselines: \textit{w/o AFS}, \textit{w/o GFF}, \textit{w/o CACA}, and \textit{ w/ CA}.   Observing Fig. \ref{ablation_results} and Table \ref{num3}, we found that the performance of the baseline  \textit{w/o AFS} is obviously worse than the baselines \textit{w/o GFF}, \textit{w/o CACA}, and \textit{w/ CA}. The visual results reflect that the baseline \textit{w/o GFF} produces incomplete salient object while the baseline \textit{w/o CACA} yields the result with an unclear boundary.  Collectively, these results underscore the importance of progressive self-modality and cross-modality channel attention while fusing important spatial features of multi-modalities.



\noindent
\textbf{Saliency-guided Position-Edge Attention (sg-PEA).} We compare with three baselines: \textit{w/o PEA}, \textit{w/o PA}, and \textit{w/o EA}. In Fig. \ref{ablation_results}, the baseline \textit{w/o PEA} fails to highlight the position and edge of salient object. The baseline \textit{w/o PA} has a sharper boundary of partial complete object while the baseline \textit{w/o PE} shows a more complete object but unclear boundary. In contrast, our full model achieves better performance than these three baselines as presented in Table \ref{num3}.


In summary, the ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed three modules qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, the ablation studies also demonstrate that careful feature modulation, selection, and refinement can effectively improve the performance of RGB-D SOD.

\section{Conclusion}

We propose an RGB-D SOD network equipped with cross-modality feature modulation and adaptive feature selection.
The former effectively integrates the multi-modality complementarities while the latter adaptively highlights saliency-related features.
We demonstrate that both elaborate integration of cross-modality features  and adaptive selection of multi-modality spatial and channel features can boost the performance of SOD. Experiment results also demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks.
