\title{The interval constrained 3-coloring problem}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we settle the open complexity status of interval constrained coloring with a fixed number of colors. We prove that the problem is already NP-complete if the number of different colors is 3. Previously, it has only been known that it is NP-complete, if the number of colors is part of the input and that the problem is solvable in polynomial time, if the number of colors is at most 2. We also show that it is hard to satisfy almost all of the constraints for a feasible instance. This implies APX-hardness of maximizing the number of simultaneously satisfiable intervals.

\section{Introduction}

In the interval constrained 3-coloring problem, we are given a set  of intervals defined on  and a \emph{requirement} function , which maps each interval to a triple of non-negative integers. The objective is to determine a coloring  such that each interval gets the proper colors as specified by the requirements, i.e.~ where  are the three unit vectors of .

This problem is motivated by an application in biochemistry to investigate the tertiary structure of proteins as shown in the following illustration.
\begin{figure}[hb]

 \includegraphics[height=30mm,page=1]{figures.pdf}
 \caption{Coloring of the residues of a protein chain according to their exchange rates.}
 \label{fig:bio}
\end{figure}
More precisely, in Hydrogen-Deuterium-Exchange (HDX) experiments proteins are put into a solvent of heavy water () for a certain time after which the amount of residual hydrogen atoms, that have exchanged with deuterium atoms, is measured~\cite{LEHMP02}. Doing this experiment for several timesteps, one can determine the exchange rate of the residues. These exchange rates indicate the solvent accessibility of the residues and hence they provide information about the spatial structure of the protein. Mass spectroscopy is one of the methods for measuring these exchange rates. To this end, the proteins are digested, i.e.~cut into parts which can be considered as intervals of the protein chain, and the mass uptake of each interval is measured. But thereby only bulk information about each interval can be obtained. Since there is not only one protein in the solvent but millions and they are not always cut in the same manner, we have this bulk information on overlapping fragments. That is, we are given the number of slow, medium, and fast exchanging residues for each of these intervals and our goal is to find a feasible assignment of these three exchange rates to residues such that for each interval the numbers match with the bulk information. 

Though the interval constrained 3-coloring problem is motivated by a particular application, its mathematical abstraction appears quite simple and ostensibly more general. In terms of integer linear programming, the problem can be equivalently formulated as follows. Given a matrix  with the \emph{row-wise consecutive-ones property} and three vectors , the constraints

have a binary solution, i.e.~, if and only if the corresponding interval constrained 3-coloring problem has a feasible solution. We may assume w.l.o.g.~that the requirements are consistent with the interval lengths, i.e.~, since otherwise we can easily reject the instance as infeasible. Hence, we could treat  as slack variables and reformulate the constraints as

It is known that if the matrix  has the \emph{column-wise} consecutive ones property (instead of \emph{row-wise}), then there is a reduction from the two-commodity integral flow problem, which has been proven to be NP-complete in~\cite{EIS76}. However, the NP-completeness w.r.t.~row-wise consecutive ones matrices has been an open problem in a series of papers as outlined in the following subsection. 

\subsection{Related Work}

The problem of assigning exchange rates to single residues has first been considered in~\cite{SAC08}. In that paper, the authors presented a branch-and-bound framework for solving the corresponding coloring problem with  color classes. They showed that there is a combinatorial polynomial time algorithm for the case of . Moreover, they asked the question about the complexity for . In~\cite{SWAT08}, the problem has been called \emph{interval constrained coloring}. It has been shown that the problem is NP-hard if the parameter  is part of the input. Moreover, approximation algorithms have been presented that allow violations of the requirements. That is, a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that computes a solution in which all constraints are -satisfied and a polynomial time rounding scheme, which satisfies every requirement within , based on a technique introduced in~\cite{GKPS06}. The latter implies that if the LP relaxation of~\eqref{eq} is feasible, then there is a coloring satisfying at least  of the requirements. APX-hardness of finding the maximum number of simultaneously satisfiable intervals has been shown in~\cite{Can08} for  provided that intervals may be counted with multiplicities. But still, the question about the complexity of the decision problem for fixed  has been left open. In~\cite{KNU09}, several fixed parameter tractability results have been given. However, the authors state that they do not know whether the problem is tractable for fixed . 

\subsection{Our contribution}

In this paper, we prove the hardness of the interval constrained -coloring problem for fixed parameter . In fact, we completely settle the complexity status of the problem, since 
we show that already the interval constrained 3-coloring problem is NP-hard by a reduction from 3-SAT. This hardness result holds more generally for any problem that can be formulated like \eqref{eq}.
Moreover, we even show the stronger result, that it is still difficult to satisfy almost all of the constraints for a feasible instance. More precisely, we prove that there is a constant  such that it is NP-hard to distinguish between instances where all constraints can be satisfied and those where only a  fraction of constraints can be simultaneously satisfied. To this end, we extend our reduction using expander graphs. This gap hardness result implies APX-hardness of the problem of maximizing the number of satisfied constraints. It is important to note that our construction does neither rely on multiple copies of intervals nor on inconsistent requirements for an interval, i.e.~in our construction for every interval  we have unique requirements that sum up to the length of the interval.


\section{NP-hardness}

\begin{theorem}
It is NP-hard to decide whether there exists a feasible coloring  for an instance  of the interval constrained 3-coloring problem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof is by reduction from the 3-SAT problem.

\smallskip
\noindent Suppose to be given an instance of the 3-SAT problem, defined by  clauses  and  variables . Each clause   contains 3 literals, namely . Each literal
  and  \emph{refers to} a variable , that means, it is equal to either  or  for some  in . A truth assignment for the variables  satisfies the 3-SAT instance 
if and only if, for each clause, at least one literal takes the value .

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.875 \textwidth,page=2]{figures.pdf} 
\caption{The sequence of nodes in an instance of the interval constrained 3-coloring problem.}
\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

We now construct an instance of the interval constrained 3-coloring problem.
For each clause  we introduce a sequence of consecutive nodes.
This sequence is, in its turn,  the union of three subsequences, one for each of the three literals (see Fig.~\ref{fig:1}).

In the following, for the clarity of presentation, we drop the index , if it is clear from the context. We denote color 1 by RED, color 2 by BLACK and color 3 by WHITE. 



\paragraph{Literal .}  The subsequence representing literal  is composed of 8 nodes. Among them, there are three special nodes, namely  and , that play a key role since they encode the information about the truth value of the literal and of the variable  it refers to. The basic idea is to achieve the following two goals: 1) given a feasible coloring, if  is BLACK, we want to be able to construct a truth assignment setting  to , while if  is BLACK, we want to be able to construct a truth assignment setting the variable  to ; 2) given a feasible coloring, if  is RED, we want to be able to construct a truth assignment where  is .

To achieve the first goal, we will impose the following property: 

\begin{property}\label{(i)}
In any feasible coloring, exactly one among  and  will be BLACK.
\end{property}

\noindent To achieve the second goal, and being consistent with the first one, we must have the property that:

\begin{property}\label{(ii)}
In any feasible coloring, if , then  if , while  if . 
\end{property}

\noindent To guarantee properties~\eqref{(i)} and \eqref{(ii)}, we introduce a suitable set  of 
six intervals\footnote{In principle, interval  and the node it contains are not needed. However, this allows to have the same number of WHITE and BLACK colored nodes for the sake of exposition.}, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}a. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width = 0.42 \textwidth,page=3]{figures.pdf}} \hspace*{0.05 \textwidth}
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width = 0.42 \textwidth,page=4]{figures.pdf}}
\caption{Literal . The picture on the right shows the three feasible colorings. On a black and white 
printout red color appears as grey.}
\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

\noindent The requirement function for such intervals changes whether  or . If , we let ; ; ; ; ;  . For any feasible coloring there are only three possible outcomes for such sequence, reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}b.
Observe that the properties \eqref{(i)} and \eqref{(ii)} are enforced.

Now suppose that :  then we switch the requirement function with respect to WHITE and BLACK, i.e. define it as follows: ; ; ; ; ;  .
Trivially, the possible outcomes for such sequence are exactly the ones in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}b but exchanging the BLACK and WHITE colors.
 
\paragraph{Literal .}  The sequence of nodes representing literal  is similar to the one representing .  We still have a sequence of 8 nodes, and three special nodes  and .
As before, we let  and  encode the truth value of the variable  that is referred to by , while  encodes the truth value of the literal  itself. Therefore, we introduce a set  of intervals in order to 
enforce the following properties:

\begin{property}\label{(iii)}
In any feasible coloring, exactly one among  and  will receive color BLACK. 
\end{property}

\begin{property}\label{(iv)}
In any feasible coloring, if , then  if , while  if . 
\end{property}

\noindent Fig.~\ref{fig:3}a shows the nodes and the six intervals that belong to : observe that the sequence is similar to the one representing ,  but the position of node   and the intervals are now ``mirrored''.
If , we let ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  .  
Fig.~\ref{fig:3}b reports the three possible outcomes for such sequence in a feasible coloring.  
Note that properties \eqref{(iii)} and \eqref{(iv)} hold.

Now suppose that : once again, we switch the requirement function with respect to WHITE and BLACK.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width = 0.425 \textwidth,page=5]{figures.pdf}} \hspace*{0.05 \textwidth} 
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width = 0.425 \textwidth,page=6]{figures.pdf}}
\caption{Literal }
\label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Literal .} The sequence of nodes representing literal  is slightly more complicated. It is composed of 36 nodes, and among them there are 4 special nodes, namely  and  (see Fig.~\ref{fig:4}). 
Still, we let  and  encode the truth value of the variable  that is referred to by , while  and  encode the truth value of the literal. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.9 \textwidth,page=7]{figures.pdf} 
\caption{Literal }
\label{fig:4}
\end{figure}

Similarly to the previous cases, we want to achieve the following goals: 1) given a feasible coloring, if  is BLACK, we want to be able to construct a truth assignment setting the variable  to , while if  is BLACK, we want to be able to construct a truth assignment setting the variable  to ; 2) given a feasible coloring, if  RED, we want to be able to construct a truth assignment where the literal  is . We are therefore interested in the following properties:

\begin{property}\label{(v)}
In any feasible coloring, exactly one among  and  will receive color BLACK.
\end{property}
 
\begin{property}\label{(vi)}
In any feasible coloring, if  and , then  if , and  if . 
\end{property}

\noindent In this case, we introduce a set  of 14 suitable intervals, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}. 
The requirements for the case  are given in the following table.


\noindent Observe that the set of intervals  is defined exactly as the set , therefore the possible outcomes for the sequence of 8 nodes covered by such intervals are as in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}b.  
Similarly, the set of intervals  is defined exactly as the set , therefore the possible outcomes for the sequence of 8 nodes covered by such intervals are as in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}b.  
Combining  and  with , it follows that in any feasible coloring , exactly one node among  and  has WHITE (resp. BLACK) color, 
enforcing Property .
Still, note that if  and , then both the leftmost node and the rightmost node covered by interval  have color BLACK, therefore  must have color WHITE otherwise  is violated. Together with Property  \eqref{(v)}, this enforces Property \eqref{(vi)}.  

In case , once again we switch the requirement function with respect to WHITE and BLACK. 

\smallskip
\noindent It remains to describe the role played by the first 13 nodes and the last 15 nodes of the sequence, that so far we did not consider. We are going to do it in the next paragraph.

\paragraph{Intervals encoding truth values of literals.} For each clause , we add another set  of intervals, in order to link the nodes encoding the truth values of its three literals. The main goal we pursue is the following: given a feasible coloring, we want to be able to construct a truth assignment such that at least one of the three literals is . To achieve this, already having properties \eqref{(ii)}, \eqref{(iv)} and \eqref{(vi)}, we only need the following property:

\begin{property}\label{(vii)}
For any feasible coloring, if  and  , then .
\end{property}

\noindent Fig.~\ref{fig:5} shows the six intervals that belong to . The requirement function is:      . We now show that Property \eqref{(vii)} holds.
Suppose  is a feasible coloring, and let  be the first 13 nodes of the sequence introduced for literal . By construction, if , then there is a node  and  , otherwise  is violated. Similarly, if , then there is a node  and  , otherwise  is violated. On the other hand, this subsequence contains exactly one node with RED color, otherwise  is violated. It follows that at least one among  and  has RED color. The same conclusions can be stated for nodes  and . Putting all together, it follows that the Property \eqref{(vii)} holds. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.9 \textwidth,page=8]{figures.pdf} 
\caption{Set of intervals .}
\label{fig:5}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Intervals encoding truth value of variables (later also called: variable intervals).} Our last set of intervals will force different nodes to take the same color, if they encode the truth value of the same variable. In particular, we aim at having the following property:

\begin{property}\label{(viii)}
In any feasible coloring,  if both literals  and  refer to the same variable .
\end{property}

\noindent To achieve this, for each pair of such literals we add a big interval  from  to  (assuming  without loss of generality). Note that, by construction, there is a subset of intervals that partitions all the internal nodes covered by the interval. That means, we know exactly the number of such nodes that must be colored with color RED, BLACK and WHITE (say  respectively). Then, we let the requirement function be . Under these assumptions, if  is a feasible coloring then  , and in particular one node will have WHITE color and the other one BLACK color. Combining this with properties \eqref{(i)},\eqref{(iii)} and \eqref{(v)}, the result follows.


\medskip
Notice that such an interval constrained 3-coloring instance can clearly be constructed in polynomial time. Now we discuss the following claim in more details.

\begin{claim}
There exists a truth assignment satisfying the 3-SAT instance if and only if there exists a feasible coloring  for the interval constrained 3-coloring instance.
\end{claim}

First, suppose there exists a feasible coloring. We construct a truth assignment as follows. We set a variable  to  if , and to  otherwise, where  is any literal referring to . 
Note that, by Property  \eqref{(viii)}, the resulting truth value does not depend on the literal we take. 
Still, combining Property \eqref{(vii)} with properties \eqref{(ii)},\eqref{(iv)} and \eqref{(vi)}, we conclude that, for each clause, at least one literal will be . By construction, we therefore end up with a truth assignment satisfying the 3-SAT instance. The result follows.

\smallskip
Now suppose that there is a truth assignment satisfying the 3-SAT instance. The basic idea, is to construct a coloring  such that the following property holds for all literals: 



\begin{property}\label{(viv)}
 BLACK (resp. WHITE) if and only if  refers to a -variable (resp. -variable).
\end{property}

\smallskip
\noindent Consider the sequence of nodes representing literal , and suppose  for some . We color such nodes as in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}b-\emph{(1)} if the literal is  in the truth assignment, and as in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}b\emph{-(3)} otherwise. If , switch BLACK and WHITE colors, in both previous cases. Now focus on the sequence of nodes representing literal . If  for some , we color such nodes as in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}b-\emph{(1)} if the literal is , and as in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}b\emph{-(3)} otherwise. If , switch BLACK and WHITE colors, in both previous cases. Finally, consider the sequence of nodes representing literal . Suppose . We color the 18 nodes in the middle of the sequence as in Fig.~\ref{fig:8}\emph{-(1)} if  is , as in Fig.~\ref{fig:8}\emph{-(2)} if both  and  are , and as in Fig.~\ref{fig:8}\emph{-(3)}  otherwise. Once again, if , we switch BLACK and WHITE colors, in all the previous three cases. Notice that, 
by construction, Property \eqref{(viv)} holds, and all requirements for the intervals in   and ) are not violated. 




\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.9 \textwidth,page=9]{figures.pdf} 
\caption{Coloring of nodes representing literal }
\label{fig:8}
\end{figure}



Now we show how to color the first 13 nodes  and the last 15 nodes  of the sequence representing literal , in such a way that the requirements of the intervals  in  are not violated (. Note that, by construction, at least one node among  and  is colored with RED. In fact, if  is  then  RED, while if  then  is colored with RED. Similarly, at least one node among  and  is colored with RED, since  only if both literals  and  are : then, necessarily  is , and therefore . 
Let us focus on the nodes , and let  be the node in between  and . In the following, we refer to WHITE as the \emph{opposite} color of BLACK and vice versa. 
As we already discuss, we can have only two cases:

Case 1: . We color  with the opposite color of , and the nodes  and  with BLACK and WHITE. Note that  is not violated. We then color  with the opposite color of  respectively. 
Similarly, we color  with the opposite color of . Then, we color  and  with BLACK and WHITE, so that  is not violated.  
Once again, we assign to  the opposite color of  respectively. Finally, we let . Note that  is not violated.

Case 2:  and , or vice versa. Suppose  (the other case is similar). Both nodes  and  can have only BLACK or WHITE colors. Then, we can color  and  with the opposite color of  and  respectively, and  with color RED, so that  is not violated. Still, we color
 and  with the opposite color of  and . Finally, we color  and  with BLACK and WHITE. To the remaining nodes  we assign the same colors as in Case 1. One checks that requirements of intervals  and  are not violated. 

One can prove in a similar manner that nodes  can be properly colored, without violating the requirements of intervals . 


\smallskip
Finally, since Property \eqref{(viv)} holds, it is easy to see that, for each couple of literals , the requirement  is also not violated. The result then follows.

 




\end{proof}


\section{Gap hardness}

We will now argue that not only the interval constrained 3-coloring problem
but also its gap version is NP-hard, i.e., it is hard to distinguish between
satisfiable instances and those where only up to a  fraction
of constraints may be simultaneously satisfied.

For the purpose of our argument we will use the following, rather restricted, 
definition of gap hardness. We will only talk about 
maximization versions of constraint satisfaction problems.
Think of an instance of the problem as being equipped with an
additional parameter  called threshold. We ask for a polynomial
time algorithm which given the instance answers: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
``YES'' if all the constraints
can be satisfied, 
\item
``NO'' if there is no solution satisfying
more than  constraints.
\end{itemize}
Note that for instances, where more than  but not all constraints
can be simultaneously satisfied, any answer is acceptable.
We will now restrict our attention to the case where the threshold is a fixed fraction
of the total amount of constraints in the instance. 
We call problem A to be \emph{gap NP-hard} if there exists a positive 
such that there is no polynomial time algorithm to separate feasible instances
from those where only at most a  fraction of the constraint can be simultaneously
satisfied unless .

Observe that gap NP-hardness implies APX-hardness, but not vice versa.
For example the linear ordering problem (also known as max-subdag) is APX-hard~\cite{papa_apx}, 
but is not gap NP-hard, since feasible instances may be found by topological sorting.

Let us first note that the 3-SAT problem, which we used in the reduction
from the previous section, has the gap hardness property. It is the essence
of the famous PCP theorems that problems with such gap hardness exist.
For a proof of the gap hardness of 3-SAT see~\cite{gap_amp}.

Before we show how to modify our reduction to prove gap hardness of the interval constraint coloring problem,
we need to introduce the notion of \emph{expander graphs}. 
For brevity we will only give the following extract from~\cite{gap_amp}.

\begin{definition}
  Let  be a -regular graph. Let 
  equal the number of edges from a subset  to its complement. The \emph{edge expansion}
  of  is defined as
  
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  There exists  and , such that there is a polynomial-time constructible family
   of -regular graphs  on  vertices with . (Such graphs
  are called expanders).
\end{lemma}

Let us now give a ``gap preserving'' reduction from gap 3-SAT to 
gap interval constrained 3-coloring. Consider the reduction from the previous section.
Observe that the amount of intervals in each literal gadget, and therefore also in each clause gadget, is constant.
The remaining intervals are the variable intervals. While it is sufficient for 
the NP-hardness proof to connect occurrences of the same variable in a ``clique'' fashion with
variable intervals, it produces a potentially quadratic number of intervals.
Alternatively, one could connect these occurrences in a ``path'' fashion,
but it would give too little connectivity for the gap reduction.
The path-like connection has the desired property of using only linear amount of intervals,
since each occurrence of a variable is linked with at most two other ones.
We aim at providing more connectivity while not increasing the amount of intervals too much.
A perfect tool to achieve this goal is a family of expander graphs.

Consider the instance of the interval coloring problem obtained by the reduction
from the previous section, but without any variable intervals yet.
Consider literal gadgets corresponding to occurrences of a particular variable .
Think of these occurrences as of vertices of a graph . Take an expander graph  
and connect two occurrences of  if the corresponding vertices in the expander are connected. 
For each such connection use a pair of intervals. These intervals should be the
original variable interval and an interval that is one element shorter on each of the sides.
We will call this pair of intervals a variable link.
Repeat this procedure for each of the variables.

Observe that the number of variable links that we added is linear
since all the used expander graphs are -regular.
By contrast to the simple path-like connection, we now have the property,
that different occurrences of the same variable have high edge connectivity.
This can be turned into high penalty for inconsistent valuations 
of literals in an imperfect solution.  

\begin{theorem}
Constrained interval 3-coloring is gap NP-hard.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We will argue that the above described reduction is a gap-preserving reduction from
the gap 3-SAT problem to the gap interval 3-coloring problem. We need to prove that
there exists a positive  such that feasible instances are hard to separate from
those less than  satisfiable.

Let  be the constant in the gap hardness of gap 3-SAT.
We need to show two properties: that the ``yes'' instances of the gap 3-SAT problem
are mapped to ``YES'' instances of our problem, and also that the ``NO''
instances are mapped to ``NO'' instances. 

The first property is simple, already in the NP-hardness proof in the previous section
it was shown that feasible instances are mapped by our reduction into feasible ones.  
To show the second property, we will take the reverse direction and argue that
an almost feasible solution to the coloring instance can be transformed into an almost feasible
solution to the SAT instance.

Suppose we are given a coloring  that violates at most  fraction of the constraints.
Suppose the original 3-SAT instance has  clauses, then our interval coloring instance has at most 
intervals for some constant . The number of unsatisfied intervals in the coloring  is then at most .

We will say that a clause is \emph{broken} if at least one of the intervals encoding it is not satisfied by . 
We will say that a variable link is broken if one of its intervals is not satisfied or one of the clauses it connects is broken. An unsatisfied variable link interval contributes a single broken link; an unsatisfied interval within a clause breaks at most  intervals connected to the clause. Therefore, there is at most  broken
variable links in total.

Recall that each variable link that is not broken connects
occurrences of the same variable in two different not broken clauses. 
Moreover, by the construction of the variable link, these two occurrences 
display the same logical value of the variable.

Consider the truth assignment  obtained as follows. For each variable consider its occurrences
in the not broken clauses. Each occurrence associates a logical value to the variable.
Take for this variable the value that is displayed in the bigger set of not broken clauses,
break ties arbitrarily.

We will now argue, that  satisfies a big fraction of clauses.
Call a clause \emph{bad} if it is not broken, but it contains a literal
such that in the coloring  this literal was active, but  evaluates
this literal to false. Observe that if a clause is neither broken nor bad, then
it is satisfied by . It remains to bound the amount of bad clauses.

Consider the clauses that become bad from the choice of a value that 
assigns to a particular variable . Let  be the number of such clauses. 
By the connectivity property of expanders,
the amount of variable links connecting these occurrences of  with other occurrences
is at least . As we observed above, all these variable links are broken.
Since there are in total at most  broken links, we obtain that 
there is at most  bad clauses. Hence, there are at most
 clauses that are either bad or broken and they cover
all the clauses not satisfied by .

It remains to fix  to obtain the property,
that more than  unsatisfiable instances of 3-SAT are mapped to more than
 unsatisfiable instances of the constrained interval 3-coloring problem.
