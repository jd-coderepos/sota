\begin{abstract}
Language modelling provides a step towards intelligent communication systems by harnessing large repositories of written human knowledge to better predict and understand the world. In this paper, we present an analysis of Transformer-based language model performance across a wide range of model scales --- from models with tens of millions of parameters up to a 280 billion parameter model called \gopher. These models are evaluated on 152 diverse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the majority. Gains from scale are largest in areas such as reading comprehension, fact-checking, and the identification of toxic language, but logical and mathematical reasoning see less benefit. We provide a holistic analysis of the training dataset and model’s behaviour, covering the intersection of model scale with bias and toxicity.  Finally we discuss the application of language models to AI safety and the mitigation of downstream harms.

\section{Introduction}
Natural language communication is core to intelligence, as it allows ideas to be efficiently shared between humans or artificially intelligent systems.
The generality of language allows us to express many intelligence tasks as taking in natural language input and producing natural language output.

Autoregressive language modelling
--- predicting the future of a text sequence from its past ---
provides a simple yet powerful objective that admits formulation of numerous cognitive tasks. At the same time, it opens the door to plentiful training data: the internet, books, articles, code, and other writing. 
However this training objective is only an approximation to any specific goal or application, since we predict everything in the sequence rather than only the aspects we care about. 
Yet if we treat the resulting models with appropriate caution, we believe they will be a powerful tool to capture some of the richness of human intelligence.


Using language models as an ingredient towards intelligence contrasts with their original application: transferring text over a limited-bandwidth communication channel. Shannon's Mathematical Theory of Communication~\citep{shannon1948mathematical} linked the statistical modelling of natural language with compression, showing that measuring the cross entropy of a language model is equivalent to measuring its compression rate. Shannon fit early language models to real data via precomputed tables of text statistics~\citep{dewey1923relativ} relating model complexity to improved text compression alongside more realistic text generation.\footnote{A sample from Shannon's word-pair model: ``the head and in frontal attack on an english writer that the character of this point is therefore another method for the letters that the time of who ever told the problem for an unexpected.''}  But the relation to intelligence was there from the start: Shannon posits that a sufficiently complex model will resemble human communication adequately, and the \textit{Imitation Game}~\citep{turing1950computing} cemented the link. The relation between data compression (via prediction) and intelligence has been further expanded upon since (see \citet{wolff1982language, chater1999search, legg2007universal}).



A key driver towards better language models has been modern computing. From their pen-and-paper origins, language models have transformed in capacity and predictive power by the exponential rise in compute~\citep{moore1965cramming}. In the 1990s and 2000s, -gram models saw increases in scale and better smoothing approaches~\citep{ney1994structuring}, including a 300 billion -gram model trained on two trillion tokens of text~\citep{brants2007large}.  These models have been applied to speech recognition~\citep{jelinek1997statistical}, spelling correction~\citep{brill2000improved}, machine translation~\citep{brown1990statistical}, and many other areas. However -gram models become statistically and computationally inefficient as the context length is increased, which limits the richness of language they can model.


In the past two decades language models have progressed to neural networks that capture the structure of language implicitly~\citep{bengio2003neural, mikolov2010recurrent, graves2013generating, jozefowicz2016exploring, radford2019language}.
Progress has been driven by both scale and network architecture~\citep{hochreiter1997long,bahdanau2014neural,vaswani2017attention}.
\citet{rosenfeld2020a} and \citet{kaplan2020scaling} independently found power laws relating cross entropy loss to model size for recurrent and Transformer neural language models respectively.  The empirically predicted gains to scale were realised in practice by the \textit{Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3} (GPT-3, \citet{gpt3}), a 175 billion parameter Transformer trained over 300 billion tokens of text, which consumed zettaflops of compute to train --- an order of magnitude beyond prior work~\citep{rosset2020turing}. GPT-3 demonstrated unprecedented generation quality alongside generalist capabilities across many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks --- notably when prompted with examples (termed few-shot prompting).


In this paper we describe a protocol for training a state-of-the-art large language model and present a 280 billion parameter model called \gopher. We outline the methods of architecture specification, optimisation, infrastructure, and the curation of a high-quality text dataset \massivetext in \autoref{sec:method}. We perform a broad analysis of benchmark performance across 152 tasks that examine several diverse aspects of intelligence, and summarise the key results in \autoref{sec:results}. We see that \gopher lifts the performance over current state-of-the-art language models across roughly 81\% of tasks containing comparable results, notably in knowledge-intensive domains such as fact checking and general knowledge. 

As harmful content occurs both in \gopher's training set and in many potential downstream applications, we examine model toxicity and bias in~\autoref{sec:model_analysis} with a focus on how scale influences these properties. We find larger models are more likely to generate toxic responses when provided with toxic prompts, but they can also more accurately classify toxicity. 
We also analyse \gopher in a dialogue-interaction setting in \autoref{sec:dialogue} via prompting and present several transcripts to demonstrate qualitative capabilities and limitations of the model.


Finally, we discuss the ethical and safe application of these models including which types of undesirable behaviour to mitigate before and after training in \autoref{sec:discussion}. We discuss application-driven safety and the potential for language models to accelerate research towards safer intelligent technology.


\section{Background}
\label{background}
Language modelling refers to modelling the probability of text  where  can be a sentence, paragraph, or document depending on the application. This is done by \textit{tokenizing} the string: mapping it to a sequence of integer-valued \textit{tokens}:  where  is the vocabulary (a finite set of positive integers) and  is the resulting sequence length, and modelling . Tokenization can be \textit{open-vocabulary} where any string can be uniquely tokenized, e.g., byte-level modelling, or \textit{closed-vocabulary} where only a subset of text can be uniquely represented, e.g., a list of words and a singular out-of-vocabulary token. We employ open-vocabulary tokenization via a mixture of byte-pair encoding (BPE) with a backoff to UTF-8 bytes in the style of~\citet{radford2018improving}. 


The typical way to model the token sequence  is via the \textit{chain rule} . This is also known as \textit{autoregressive} sequence modelling, because at each time-step the future (in this case, future token) is predicted based upon the past context. Whilst there are other objectives towards modelling a sequence, such as modelling masked tokens given bi-directional context~\citep{mikolov2013efficient, devlin2019bert} and modelling all permutations of the sequence~\citep{yang2019xlnet} we focus on autoregressive modelling due to its strong performance and simplicity. We shall refer to language models hereon as the function approximators to perform next-token prediction.

A class of neural networks known as Transformers~\citep{vaswani2017attention} have demonstrated state-of-the-art language model performance in recent years~\citep{dai2019transformer, radford2018improving, radford2019language} and this is the architecture we focus on in this paper. There has been a trend of scaling the combination of training data, model size (measured in parameters) and training computation to obtain models with improved performance across academic and industrial benchmarks. Notable models along this progression include the 345 million parameter BERT~\citep{devlin2019bert} performing strongly across a wide benchmark of language classification tasks, the 1.5 billion parameter GPT-2~\citep{radford2018improving} and 8.3 billion parameter Megatron ~\citep{shoeybi2019megatron} displaying progressively superior zero-shot language model performance, the 11 billion parameter T5~\citep{raffel2019exploring} which advanced transfer learning and performance on several closed-book question answering tasks, and the aforementioned 175 billion parameter GPT-3. The moniker \textit{Large Language Models} (LLMs) has become popular to describe this generation of larger models.

Since GPT-3 there has been a 178B parameter Transformer language model Jurassic-1~\citep{jurassic} which uses a diverse training set and a larger tokenizer vocabulary size, along with an announced 530B Megatron-Turing NLG~\citep{Megatron-Turing} which trains on a released dataset (The Pile, ~\citet{pile}) (which we evaluate on) and has reported some tentative performance numbers.
There have also been Transformer variants which incorporate a sparse mixture of experts ~\citep{fedus2021switch, roller2021hash} to increase the model size (in some cases to trillions of parameters) with more modest compute budgets. 
Other recent LLMs include two models (FLAN and T0) fine-tuned on instructions for an array of down-stream tasks ~\citep{sanh2021multitask, wei2021finetuned} which improves performance to unseen tasks --- these ideas are complementary to the initial task of building a powerful language model but we compare performance nonetheless where possible.


\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Models}
\label{method:models}
In this paper we present results on six Transformer language models ranging from 44 million to 280 billion parameters, with the architectural details displayed in \autoref{tab:arch}. We refer to the largest as \gopher and the entire set of models as the \gopher family.

We use the autoregressive Transformer architecture detailed in \citet{radford2019language} with two modifications: we use RMSNorm \citep{zhang2019root} instead of LayerNorm~\citep{ba2016layer}, 
and we use the relative positional encoding scheme from \citet{dai2019transformer} rather than absolute positional encodings.
Relative encodings permit us to evaluate on longer sequences than we trained on, which improves the modelling of articles and books as shown in \autoref{appendix:context_len_scaling}.
We tokenize the text using SentencePiece~\citep{kudo2018sentencepiece} with a vocabulary of 32,000 and use a byte-level backoff to support open-vocabulary modelling. 
The \gopher model card \citep{mitchell2019model} is included in \autoref{appendix:gopher-model-card}.

    \label{tab:arch}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Training}
\label{method:training}
We train all models for 300 billion tokens with a 2048 token context window, using the Adam \citep{kingma2014adam} optimiser.
We warm-up the learning rate from  to the maximum learning rate over the first 1500 steps, and then decay it 10 using a cosine schedule.
As we increase model size, we decrease the maximum learning rate and increase the number of tokens in each batch, as shown in \autoref{tab:arch}.
Furthermore, we increase \gopher's batch size from three to six million tokens per batch during training.
We clip gradients based on the global gradient norm using a clipping value of 1.
However, for the 7.1B model and for \gopher we reduce this to 0.25 for improved stability.

We incorporate the \texttt{bfloat16} numerical format to reduce memory and increase training throughput. Models smaller than 7.1B are trained with mixed precision \texttt{float32} parameters and \texttt{bfloat16} activations \citep{micikevicius2017mixed}, while 7.1B and 280B use \texttt{bfloat16} activations \textit{and} parameters. \texttt{bfloat16} parameters are updated using stochastic rounding to maintain stability~\citep{gupta2015deep}.
We subsequently found that stochastic rounding does not fully recover mixed precision training performance; more details can be found in \autoref{app:lessons_learned}.

\subsection{Infrastructure}
\label{method:infra}
We built our training and evaluation codebase with JAX \citep{jax2018github} and Haiku \citep{haiku2020github}.
In particular, we use JAX's \texttt{pmap} transformation to efficiently express both data and model parallelism.
We trained and evaluated all models on TPUv3 chips~\citep{tpuacm}.


The half-precision parameters and single-precision Adam state for \gopher occupy 2.5 TiB, which far exceeds the 16 GiB of memory available on each TPUv3 core. To address these memory concerns, we use optimiser state partitioning \citep{rajbhandari2020zero}, model parallelism \citep{shoeybi2019megatron}, and rematerialisation \citep{griewank2000algorithm} to partition the model state and reduce the activations so that they fit in TPU memory.

We find that both data and model parallelism are low-overhead on TPUv3s due to their fast cross-chip communication and only incur a 10\% overhead when training \gopher. Therefore, we find that pipelining \citep{huang2019gpipe} is not necessary on TPUs until the training scale exceeds the 1024-chip ``pod'', which greatly simplifies training mid-sized models.
However, pipelining is an efficient parallelism method on commodity networks due to its low communication volume, so is well suited to connecting multiple TPU pods.
In summary, we train \gopher by using model and data parallelism within TPU pods and pipelining across them. We verified through simulation that this topology was sensible for our hardware \citep{automap2021}; see \autoref{tab:scaling_time} for details.

\end{tabular}
    \caption{\textbf{MassiveText data makeup.} For each subset of \massivetext, we list its total disk size, its number of documents, and its number of SentencePiece tokens. During training we sample from \massivetext non-uniformly, using the sampling proportion shown in the right-most column.}
    \label{tab:data_makeup}
\end{table*}

We train the \gopher family of models on \massivetext, a collection of large English-language text datasets from multiple sources: web pages, books, news articles, and code. \autoref{tab:data_makeup} details the constituent datasets. Our data pipeline (\autoref{app:dataset_pipeline_stages}) includes text quality filtering, removal of repetitious text, deduplication of similar documents, and removal of documents with significant test-set overlap. 
We find that successive stages of this pipeline improve language model downstream performance (\autoref{sec:massiveweb_ablations}), emphasising the importance of dataset quality.

Overall, \massivetext contains 2.35 billion documents, or about 10.5 TB of text. 
Since we train \gopher on 300B tokens (12.8\% of the tokens in the dataset), we sub-sample from \massivetext with sampling proportions specified per subset (books, news, etc.). We tune these sampling proportions to maximise downstream performance (see \autoref{app:dataset_subset_weightings} for details). The largest sampling subset is our curated web-text corpus \massiveweb, which we find to improve downstream performance relative to existing web-text datasets such as C4~\citep{raffel2020exploring} in \autoref{fig:massiveweb_ablations}. 
We give further details of \massivetext in \autoref{appendix:massive-text} and provide the \massivetext datasheet in \autoref{tab:massivetext-datasheet}.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We compile the performance of \gopher and its family of smaller models across 152 tasks. We compare these results to prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for language models (124 tasks with published LM performance), supervised approaches which make use of task-specific data, and human performance where available. In this section we present a summary of key findings, and refer to~\autoref{app:results} for the full set of results and task-specific methodology.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{\textbf{Evaluation Tasks.} We compile results for the \gopher family of models on 152 tasks.}
    \label{tab:task_summary}
\end{table}

We build a profile of language model performance that spans mathematics, common sense, logical reasoning, general knowledge, scientific understanding, ethics, and reading comprehension --- alongside conventional language modelling benchmarks. 
We include composite benchmarks (such as \citet{bigbench}) which contain a mixture of tasks, alongside a number of established targeted benchmarks such as RACE for reading comprehension~\citep{race} and FEVER for fact-checking~\citep{fever}, among others. We list our task sources in \autoref{tab:task_summary}.

We select tasks that require the model to estimate the probability of target text as we find this to be a general interface that supports the probing of knowledge and reasoning capabilities.
For language modelling tasks we calculate the bits per byte (BPB), a compression measure where a lower value indicates a higher probability placed on the correct continuation. All other tasks follow a multiple-choice format, where the model outputs a probability to each multiple-choice response given a context and question, and we select the response with the highest probability. Here, we measure the accuracy of a correct response.   

We filter out training documents that are very similar to test-set instances for tasks that were created before \massivetext (November 2020) as described in~\autoref{app:test_set_filtering}. Furthermore some tasks have been designed to use unique test-set problem statements that should not benefit from pre-existing text data --- such as \bigbench. However we caution that there may be test set leakage within our training set; we discuss the challenges of test-set leakage and generalisation in~\autoref{app:memorisation}.

\subsection{Comparisons with State of the Art}

In \autoref{fig:sota_overview} we present an overview of \gopher results with comparisons to state-of-the-art language model performance. Results are comparable across 124 tasks and we plot the percent change in performance metric (higher is better) of \gopher versus the current LM SOTA.\footnote{\gopher comprises both our model and our training dataset. It is still informative to compare \gopher to previous SOTA LM approaches. Additionally, in this paper we also discuss the performance of \gopher as we vary the model capacity while holding the dataset fixed.}
\gopher outperforms the current state-of-the-art for 100 tasks (81\% of all tasks). The baseline model includes LLMs such as GPT-3 (175B parameters)~\citep{gpt3}, Jurassic-1~\citep{jurassic} (178B parameters), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B parameters)~\citep{Megatron-Turing}; the exact baseline is specified per task in~\autoref{fig:results_overview}. 

We find that \gopher displays the most uniform improvement across reading comprehension, humanities, ethics, STEM and medicine categories. We see a general improvement on fact-checking.
For common sense reasoning, logical reasoning, and maths we see much smaller performance improvements and several tasks that have a deterioration in performance. 
The general trend is less improvement in reasoning-heavy tasks (e.g., \textit{Abstract Algebra}) and a larger and more consistent improvement in knowledge-intensive tests (e.g., \textit{General Knowledge}).
Next is a discussion of a few specific sets of results.

For \textbf{language model benchmarks}, we expand the relative performance results of \gopher versus the current 178B SOTA model Jurassic-1 and 175B GPT-3 in~\autoref{fig:pile_gopher}. Jurassic-1 is an LLM trained with an emphasis on large-vocabulary training and has generally outperformed GPT-3 at a very similar parameter size. We see \gopher does not outperform state-of-the-art on 8 of 19 tasks, under-performing on \textit{Ubuntu IRC} and \textit{DM Mathematics} in particular, possibly due to a poor tokenizer representation for numbers. \gopher demonstrates improved modelling on 11 of 19 tasks, in particular books and articles (\textit{Books3}, \textit{PG-19}, \textit{arXiv}, etc.). This performance gain may be due to the heavy use of book data in \massivetext, with a sampling proportion of 27\% in total (e.g., versus GPT-3's 16\%).

\end{figure}

We highlight two \textbf{reading comprehension} tasks RACE-m and RACE-h, multiple-choice exams pitched at a middle-school and high-school level respectively. Inspecting the accuracy in~\autoref{tab:race} we see \gopher extend upon the current LM SOTA for high-school reading comprehension (47.9\% Megatron-Turing NLG  71.6\% \gopher) and the middle-school comprehension accuracy (58.1\% GPT-3  75.1\% \gopher). The high-school reading comprehension level approaches human-rater performance. Smaller models from the \gopher family do not perform as well on these tasks, which suggests that data alone does not explain the performance difference --- the combination of scale and data is crucial. All models are still far from human-ceiling performance (around 95\%) and supervised state-of-the-art (>90\%) which was obtained using a smaller 223M parameter ALBERT-XXL model fine-tuned on the dataset \citep{race-sota}. It is possible supervised fine-tuning leads to greater reading comprehension, but it is also plausible the datasets contain exploitable statistics which can lead to high accuracy --- as has been recently discovered for several common-sense reasoning benchmarks~\citep{li2021systematic}.

\label{fig:fever}
\end{figure}


For some of the most well-studied \textbf{common sense reasoning} tasks: \textit{Winogrande}, \textit{HellaSwag} and \textit{PIQA}, \gopher is outperformed by the larger Megatron-Turing NLG by a small amount (1.2\%, 0.2\% and 4.1\% respectively), but all LM approaches trail human-level performance considerably (\autoref{sec:common_sense}).  As with the mathematics tasks, this suggests that these models have limited reasoning capabilities.


We next highlight \textbf{fact-checking}. This is an important problem within the domain of tackling misinformation. We find that \gopher outperforms supervised SOTA approaches on the well-studied \textit{FEVER} fact-checking benchmark when evidence is supplied. We see across model sizes in~\autoref{fig:fever} that scale improves both the checking of facts given gold evidence alongside the `closed book' checking of facts with a claim only. However, larger scale does not benefit the classification of facts which are unknown versus false, implying that larger models improve fact checking performance by knowing more facts versus forming a deeper understanding of misinformation at this stage.

\end{table}


Moving beyond per-task performance, we display the average accuracy across the 57 tasks in \textbf{MMLU} (\autoref{tab:mmlu}). These tasks consist of real-world human exams covering a range of academic subjects.
We have comparisons from GPT-3~\citep{gpt3}, and a 11B T5 model fine-tuned on question tasks called UnifiedQA~\citep{khashabi2020unifiedqa}. These baseline model results along with human rater and expert performance were collected by~\citet{hendrycks2020measuring}. In \autoref{tab:mmlu} we see that \gopher achieves an overall accuracy of \textbf{60\%}, well above GPT-3's 43.9\% and UnifiedQA's 48.9\%.
Whilst this lifts the known performance of the pure language-model approach, it still trails the estimated human expert performance of 89.8\%. We also display how this performance contrasts with human expectations.
From a competitive forecasting platform Hypermind\footnote{\url{https://prod.hypermind.com/ngdp/en/showcase2/showcase.html?sc=JSAI\#q4}}, human forecasters aim to predict the accuracy of machine learning systems on this benchmark by set dates for prizes --- according to the September 2021 average forecast, \gopher-level performance was expected between June 2022 and June 2023.


We conclude that \gopher lifts the baseline performance of a language-model approach across a wide set of tasks. In some settings (e.g., RACE reading comprehension and FEVER fact-checking) \gopher nears human rater performance or the performance of supervised models designed for particular problem domains. However for a few categories of tasks (e.g., mathematical reasoning and common-sense) there is less of an improvement and this may indicate a limitation to the large-scale language model approach. Next, we consider the topic of model scale in isolation.


\subsection{Performance Improvements with Scale}
Next, we investigate which types of tasks benefit from scaling model size. In this section we compare the performance of \gopher (280B) to smaller models ( 7.1B). Because the \gopher family of models are all trained on the same dataset for the same number of tokens, this allows us to isolate the effect of scaling parameters and training compute for each task.   

We compute the relative performance improvement of \gopher (280B) versus the best performance up to 7.1B over all 152 tasks. 
The most performant smaller \gopher family model is usually, but not always, our 7.1B model. 
We find that \gopher demonstrates a performance improvement on the vast majority of tasks -- only  (10.5\%) had zero or no performance gains.
In contrast,  (37.5\%) tasks had small improvements,  with relative performance increases of up to 25\%, and 79 (51.2\%) tasks had significant improvements of over 25\%. We then visualise relative performance improvement by task category in \autoref{fig:scale_improvement}.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/gopher_vs_7b_v4.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{280B vs best performance up to 7.1B} across different tasks.
    We compare the performance of \gopher to the best performance of our smaller models up to 7.1B. 
    In nearly every case, \gopher outperforms the best smaller model's performance. Small gains come from either scale not improving results substantially or the smaller models already being very performant.
    Language modelling improvements are in BPB and the rest are in terms of accuracy.}
    \label{fig:scale_improvement}
\end{figure}


Some of the largest benefits of scale are seen in the Medicine, Science, Technology, Social Sciences, and the Humanities task categories.
These same categories are also where we see the greatest performance improvement over LM SOTA, as described in the previous section. Highlighting some specific tasks:
for \textbf{Figure of Speech Detection} from \bigbench we obtain the largest gains-- a 314\% increase.
\gopher achieved an impressive 52.7\% accuracy whereas the 7.1B model achieved only 16.8\% accuracy.
\gopher also dramatically improves over the smaller models in \textbf{Logical Args}, \textbf{Marketing}, and \textbf{Medical Genetics}.
For the \textbf{TruthfulQA} benchmark~\citep{truthfulqa} we find performance improvement with scale (from 1.4B to 280B), despite scale appearing to \textit{hurt} performance for several other model families such as GPT-J, GPT-2, T5, GPT-3. Furthermore, 280B is the first model to demonstrate performance significantly beyond random guessing on the multiple-choice TruthfulQA task formulation (more details in~\autoref{appendix:truthfulqa}).
These results highlight that on some tasks, scale seems to ``unlock'' the ability of a model to significantly improve performance on particular tasks. 

On the other hand, we find that scale has a reduced benefit for tasks in the Maths, Logical Reasoning, and Common Sense categories.
Our results suggest that for certain flavours of mathematical or logical reasoning tasks, it is unlikely that \textit{scale} alone will lead to performance breakthroughs. 
In some cases \gopher has a lower performance than smaller models-- examples of which include \textbf{Abstract Algebra} and \textbf{Temporal Sequences} from \bigbench, and \textbf{High School Mathematics} from MMLU.
On the other hand, the modest performance gains in common sense tasks largely come from relatively strong performance from the smaller models, limiting the room for relative improvement. 
While language modelling tasks see the smallest average improvements, this is due to the performance metric measured in BPB rather than accuracy and greatly limits the possible relative gains.

By comparing \gopher to our smaller models, we are able to specifically ask questions about the impact of model \textit{scale}. 
We conclude that while model scale plays an important role for improvements across the vast majority of tasks, the gains are not equally distributed.
Many academic subjects, along with general knowledge, see large improvements come from scale alone. 
However, this analysis also highlights areas where model scale alone is not enough, or where the gains from scale are more modest-- specifically some mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
By combining these scaling results with the comparisons of \gopher to LM SOTA, we see that \textit{scale} and the \textit{dataset} are both contributing to \gopher's strong performance in these domains.
In the next section we investigate various properties of the model relating to toxic content generation and classification, the modelling of biases, and the representation of dialects.



\section{Toxicity and Bias Analysis}
\label{sec:model_analysis}

Alongside the benefits of scaling language models, it is crucial to analyse how scale impacts potentially harmful behaviour. Here we study the behaviour of our language models with respect to problematic outputs and biases.
We investigate the tendency of models to produce toxic output, to recognise toxic text, to display distributional bias in discourse about different groups of people, and to model subgroup dialects.
For each question we consider variation across model scale.

We choose evaluations and metrics which are commonly used in the field.
However, various work has discussed the limitations of current metrics and evaluations \citep{blodgett2021stereotyping,welbl2021challenges,xu2021detoxifying,blodgett2020language,sheng2019woman} and our analysis has uncovered further caveats, which we highlight in the following sections and \autoref{tox-bias-limitations}.
We include these measures despite their shortcomings to underscore the importance of tackling these challenges and to highlight specific areas for future work, rather than to establish these particular approaches as best practice.

\subsection{Toxicity}
In the Sections \ref{sec:rtp} and \ref{sec:toxicity}, we rely on the widely used and commercially deployed \perspectiveapi\footnote{\perspectiveapi was created by \textit{Jigsaw} and is available at \url{https://perspectiveapi.com}.} 
classifier to study the toxicity of text generated by LMs, and associated CivilComments dataset for studying models' ability to detect toxic text.
Accordingly, we adopt their definition of toxicity as ``a rude, disrespectful or unreasonable comment that is likely to make someone leave a discussion.''\footnote{Note that the notion of toxicity involves subjective and ambiguous elements. What is perceived as toxic depends on conversation setting, as well as cultural and societal norms, and can be underspecified in an LM context.}

\subsubsection{Generation Analysis}
\label{sec:rtp}
Our toxicity analysis of text generated by LMs follows the methodology used in \cite{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts, welbl2021challenges}. 
We use \perspectiveapi to obtain toxicity scores for LM prompts and continuations.  
We analyse the toxicity of LM outputs when sampling is conditioned on a set of prompts and when it's unconditional (i.e. unprompted), similar to \cite{welbl2021challenges}. Conditional generation allows us to analyse how the model responds to prompts that have varying toxicity scores. Prompts are from the \textit{RealToxicityPrompts} (RTP) dataset  \citep{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts}, which contains 100k naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text.
We sample 10\% of the 100k RTP prompts for efficiency and generate 25 continuations per prompt.

  }
\label{fig:rtp}
\end{figure}


The continuation toxicity of larger models is more consistent with prompt toxicity than for smaller models (\autoref{fig:rtp_cont_vs_scale}). 
When prompted, as the input toxicity increases, larger models respond with greater toxicity, plateauing near 7.1B parameters. This suggests that more parameters increase the model's ability to respond like-for-like to inputs. 

For unprompted samples, the toxicity is low and does not increase with model size. Levels are slightly lower than in the training data (\autoref{fig:violin_train_data_vs_generated}), i.e.~when unprompted, the LM does not amplify training data toxicity.
More details on our toxicity evaluation methodology, results and metrics can be found in \autoref{appendix:model_toxicity}.



\subsubsection{Classification Analysis}
\label{sec:toxicity}
We evaluate the models' ability to detect toxic text in the few-shot setting, in a manner similar to \cite{selfdiagnosis}, on the CivilComments dataset \citep{nuanced_metrics} (see  \autoref{appendix:zeroshot_toxicity} for details). 
We observe that the model's ability to classify text for toxicity increases with scale in few-shot settings (\autoref{fig:shot_toxicity}).
The smaller models perform comparably or worse than a random classifier (which would achieve an AUC of 0.5).
The largest model achieves an AUC of around  in the 20-shot setting, significantly improving on the smaller models (\autoref{fig:shot_toxicity}). 
We note that while the state-of-the-art for toxicity detection in the few-shot setting is not well established, our performance is well below that 
of state of the art classifiers 
trained specifically for toxicity detection
\citep{nuanced_metrics}.

In \autoref{appendix:zeroshot_toxicity}, 
we further explore whether large language models used for few-shot toxicity classification exhibit subgroup bias.
We measure unintended classifier bias using the 280B model with metrics introduced in \cite{nuanced_metrics}
and find that the model is prone to bias against subgroups in different ways.  
Thus, while language models can be a powerful tool for few-shot classification (especially important in tasks with data that is difficult to annotate), outcomes are not necessarily fair across subgroups.
More work is needed to understand how to best mitigate these biases, and caution must be exercised when optimising for improvements in their toxicity classification capabilities.

\subsection{Distributional Bias}
\label{sec:distributional-bias}

We define \textit{distributional biases} as biases which are not apparent in a single sample, but emerge over many samples.
For example, whereas ``The woman is a nurse'' is not a problematic sentence, it can be problematic if the model disproportionately associates women with certain occupations.
As discussed in \cite{sheng2021societal}, distributional biases in language models can have both negative representational impacts (e.g., \cite{kay2015unequal}) and allocational impacts (e.g., \cite{dastin2018Amazon}).
To investigate distributional biases in our model, we measure
stereotypical associations between gender and occupation, the distribution of sentiment in samples conditioned on different social groups, and perplexity on different dialects. 
Whereas performance across many language tasks increases with scale, we find that simply increasing model size does not remove biased language. 
Indeed, we expect models trained with a standard cross-entropy objective to reflect biases in our training data.

Progress in this space will require challenging cross-disciplinary work to outline desirable behaviour, measure and interpret model outputs, and design novel mitigations, as demonstrated by these results and the significant limitations of the following methods, discussed in \autoref{tox-bias-limitations}.

\subsubsection{Gender and Occupation Bias}

We study gender and occupation bias via two different evaluations.
First, we measure the probability of gendered words following different occupation contexts.
Second, we evaluate on the Winogender coreference resolution dataset \citep{rudinger2018gender}, where similar coreference accuracy across different pronouns indicates less gender bias.
In our evaluation, we primarily compare performance across male and female gendered terms, 
but acknowledge these terms do not represent all possible gender identities \citep{cao2021toward}.

\noindent\textbf{Gender Word Probability} To measure how probable different gender words are in different occupation contexts, we follow a setup similar to \cite{gpt3}.
We input an occupation prompt like ``The \{occupation\} was a'' into our model and compute a gender bias metric by comparing the probabilities of the prompt being followed by either male or female gendered terms.

\autoref{fig:gender_bias1} reports our probability based gender bias metric as a function of model size for two different templates (``The \{occupation\} was a \{gender\}'' and ``The \{occupation\} is a \{gender\}'').
Overall, we do not find a consistent correlation between model size and bias.
Furthermore, we find that apparently unrelated choices in template (changing ``was'' to ``is'') can alter the measured bias.
Additionally, choice of gender words also impacts results; if we only use the terms ``male'' and ``female,'' gender bias is substantially lower than when summing over a large set of gendered terms (\autoref{fig:gender_bias2}). \autoref{app:gender_occupation} contains further details of the implementation, metrics, and results.

  \caption{ \textbf{Analysis of gender and occupation bias in our models.}  (a) Gender bias metric

(b) Winogender accuracy as a function of model size for examples which oppose gender stereotypes (``gotcha'' examples) and reinforce gender stereotypes (``not gotcha'' examples).  Compared to ``not gotcha'' examples, performance on ``gotchas'' remains lower and differs between male and female pronouns. Both results are indicators of bias.
  }
\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{Winogender} 
We explore bias on a zero-shot coreference task using the Winogender dataset \citep{rudinger2018gender}.
Models are evaluated on whether they can correctly resolve a pronoun to either an occupation word or a relevant distractor word.
We expect unbiased models to have similar coreference resolution performance regardless of the pronoun gender.
This evaluation is similar to the ``disambiguation\_q'' ambiguous pronoun gender bias task reported in our \bigbench results (\autoref{sec:bb:results}).
However, here we are measuring performance in a zero-shot setting.


Similar to the \bigbench analysis, we observe that overall performance increases with model size (\autoref{fig:Winogender-main}).
Following \cite{rudinger2018gender}, we also report performance on sentences which are likely to be hard for a gender biased model (called ``gotchas'') in \autoref{fig:Winogender-gotcha}.
A ``gotcha'' example is one where the correct coreference resolution is one that differs from stereotypes (based on labor statistics\footnote{To determine if jobs are more commonly held by men or women, we use occupation statistics provided by \cite{rudinger2018gender}, which were determined from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.}).
Performance increases across both ``gotchas'' and ``not gotchas'' with model size, though performance on ``gotchas'' is considerably lower.
On ``gotcha'' examples, there is a significant difference in performance for male and female pronouns.
Thus, though performance on coreference resolution for the overall task increases considerably with size, our analysis suggests \gopher is still impacted by gender and occupation bias. 
Full details of our setup and results are in \autoref{app:gender_occupation}.


\subsubsection{Sentiment Bias towards Social Groups}
Sentiment bias is one way to quantify how generated text describes different identities and social groups.
In prior work, the difference in sentiment distributions is used to measure individual and group fairness in generative language models \citep{huang2020reducing}.
For this work, we measure the sentiment of model outputs for different occupations, countries, races, and religions. Here we present an overview, with details of metric definition, term and template lists, and full results in \autoref{app:sentiment_bias}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{subfigure}[b]{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/sentiment_distr_country.pdf}

\end{subfigure}
  \caption{\textbf{Mean continuation sentiment score by group.} Bars indicate 99\% confidence intervals. High is positive sentiment, low is negative. See \autoref{fig:sentiment_bias-appx} for religion and occupation results.}
\label{fig:sentiment_bias}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{Metrics} Following \citet{huang2020reducing}, we sample completions based on templated prompts. In each prompt, a single modifier or noun is changed to refer to a different attribute. For example, the template ``The \{attribute\} person could'' could be filled in with ``Christian,'' ``Jewish,'' or ``Muslim''. The samples for each prompt are scored between 0 (negative) to 1 (positive) by a sentiment classifier.

\noindent\textbf{Selection of templates and terms} Following \citet{gpt3,huang2020reducing} we measure sentiment for race, religion, country, and occupation.
We also extend the term set for religion and race to include an unspecified option without the attribute word (``The \{attribute\} person could'' becomes ``The person could'').
We include this unspecified option because attributes that are assumed to be the default in a particular culture or context, such as a majority or higher-status attribute, are often left unmarked (unspecified) in language \citep{waugh1982marked}. 

\noindent\textbf{Results} In \autoref{fig:sentiment_bias} and \autoref{fig:sentiment_bias-appx}, we plot the distribution of normalized sentiment scores for all completions of all prompts for each attribute, and report an aggregated group fairness metric in \autoref{fig:sentiment_group_fairness}. As in gender and occupation bias, we see no clear trend with scale. This is particularly evident for countries and occupations, while further analysis is needed to understand why particular attributes within race and religion appear to follow a slight downward trend in mean sentiment.

For sentiment distribution, we observe that certain attributes have notably lower mean sentiment scores.
To better understand this, we analyse word co-occurrences for pairs of attributes (\autoref{tab:sentiment_word_co-occurrence}).
From this, we observe our models inherit features of historical and contemporary discourse about specific groups \citep{decolonialai}. Second, similar to the gender and occupation results, the choice of demographic terms requires careful thought. See \autoref{app:sentiment_bias} for deeper discussion.


\subsubsection{Perplexity on Dialects}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{.45\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/twitter_aae_perplexity.pdf}

  \caption{\textbf{Perplexity by dialect.} (Left) Perplexity on Tweets classified as African American and White-aligned English. (Right) The relative decrease in perplexity compared to the 44M model.}
\label{fig:twitter_aae}
\end{figure}

Although \gopher has impressive performance on language benchmarks, it is only able to model text reflected in the training data. If certain dialects are underrepresented in a training corpus, there is likely to be disparate model performance in understanding such language.
To test for this gap, 
we measure the perplexity of our models on Tweets from the African American (AA)-aligned corpus and White-aligned corpus curated by \citet{twitteraae}. Our results show that perplexity on the AA-aligned corpus is higher for all model sizes.
As the model scales, perplexity for both dialects improves, but it does so at roughly the same rate so the gap does not close with scale.

These results highlight a distinct way that bias manifests in the language models. 
The preceding metrics quantify how models' outputs vary when different groups are the subject of the output, which can constitute a representational harm when it is more negative or stereotypical \citep{blodgett2020language}.  
However, the models also show disparate ability in modelling dialects, which
could lead to allocational harms in applications with users with different dialects.

\section{Dialogue}

So far, we have explored the capabilities and limitations of \gopher through quantitative methods. In this section we investigate the model through direct interaction. We find that by conditionally sampling from a dialogue prompt similar to the few-shot method of \citet{gpt3}, our \gopherchat can emulate a conversational format to a decent quality. We provide example transcripts here, with more in \autoref{appendix:gopherchat-transcripts}. We contrast this with the more conventional method of fine-tuning on dialogue data, finding that fine-tuning did not deliver significantly preferred responses in a small-scale human study. Unlike \autoref{sec:rtp}, toxicity of \gopherchat  responses does not increase with model scale, even when prompted with toxic questions (\autoref{fig:dialogue_rtp}).

\subsection{Prompting For Dialogue}

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{0.1\textwidth}p{0.85\textwidth}}
    \hline
    \textbf{Prompt} & \textbf{Generation}  \\
    \hline
    {\small What am I thinking?} & {\small It's Friday night and I'm in bed and awake at 12:37 am. "I woke up from a dream where I was standing next to... } \\
    \hline
    & {\small  The Golden Globes are over and now I need to make a list of films that I must see, most likely in the coming months} \\
    \hline
    & {\small Where am I headed? Is there another place where I can get away? Can I use my smartphone to play? How do I think I can do this?} \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{\textbf{Responses from \gopher when naively prompted with a question}, for three seeds.}
    \label{tab:gopher_doesnt_answer}
\end{table}

Language models are trained to reproduce their input distribution, not to engage in conversation. When prompted with a question, we can see that the model generates a first-person narrative, some text resembling a blog post, and a generic list of existential questions (\autoref{tab:gopher_doesnt_answer}). This behaviour is consistent with  the content that \gopher has been trained on.  

In order to produce a conversationalist, we use a prompt that describes \gopher's role and starts a conversation between \gopher and a fictional \user, including behaviours such as aversion to offensive language and an ability to opt out of certain question types; see \autoref{fig:gopherchat-prompt} for the full prompt. \autoref{fig:gopherchat-bio-example} shows a transcript with \gopherchat on the topic of cell biology and bacteria. Here it remains on topic, discusses some technical details, and provides a correct citation link. However it actually provides subtle incorrect responses in some cases (prokaryotes are not the only single-cell organisms). \autoref{fig:gopherchat-unfactual-example} shows an unsuccessful transcript illustrating factual errors confidently expressed. See \autoref{appendix:gopherchat-transcripts} for more transcripts with interesting behaviours and failure modes, including more subtle plausible but factually incorrect dialogue with a claim of search (\autoref{fig:gopherchat-trivia-lookup}), generating harmful text (\autoref{fig:gopherchat-toxic-coerced}), or contradicting itself and showing a general lack of common sense (\autoref{fig:gopherchat-dinosaurs-contradiction}). 

Anecdotally, we find both successes and failures to be common, but we emphasize that \gopherchat is \textbf{still just a language model}. The prompt conditions the model's prior over responses but does not result in a consistently reliable or factual dialogue model. We refer the reader to~\citet{weidinger2021harms} for a detailed discussion on language model harms specific to dialogue and we discuss some ideas regarding building trustworthy systems in \autoref{discussion:safety_benefits_and_risks}. 

\subsection{ Fine-tuning for Dialogue }

Recent work on dialogue often focuses on supervised training with dialogue-specific data~\citep{chen2017survey}, such as Google's \textit{Meena}~\citep{adiwardana2020towards} and Facebook's \textit{BlenderBot}~\citep{roller2020recipes}. We explore this approach by creating a curated dialogue dataset from \massiveweb and fine-tuning \gopher on this dataset for 5 billion tokens to produce \gopherchatsl. We then ask human raters for their preference over the response from \gopherchatsl and \gopherchat, using our dialogue prompt (\autoref{fig:gopherchat-prompt}) for both models. To our surprise, we find from  ratings the preference is  : no significant difference. We describe the methodology in detail in \autoref{app:gopherchat_methodology}. We consider this an interesting initial result; future work would be valuable to rigorously examine the pros and cons of fine-tuning versus prompting for dialogue with large-scale models and compare \gopher to existing dialogue systems accounting for large differences in model size. 

\begin{figure}[t]

  \caption{\textbf{Toxicity analyses of Dialogue-Prompted models.} (Left) Toxicity of text generated by Dialogue-Prompted LMs given RTP questions, bucketed by prompt toxicity.

(Right) For ``high'' toxicity prompts (>66\%), the toxicity of \gopherchat models on RTP-questions and \gopher models on RTP relative to 44M models.}
\label{fig:dialogue_rtp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dialogue \& Toxicity }

We investigate the toxicity of \gopherchat.
We adapt the RTP methodology to the dialogue setting  (called RTP questions, details in \autoref{appendix:dialgoue_rtp}). 
In \autoref{fig:dialogue_rtp} (left),  we observe that \gopherchat does not follow the same trend (increased toxicity with model scale) as \gopher.  
Whilst we see a monotonic increase in continuation toxicity with model scale in the unprompted setting (\autoref{fig:rtp_cont_vs_scale}), \gopherchat toxicity tends to slightly decrease with increased model scale (from 117M parameters, except for prompts in the most toxic bucket). Potentially, larger models can better account for the given prompt (which includes ``to be respectful, polite, and inclusive''). 
Specifically, we compare the continuation toxicity between \gopher (tested on RTP) and \gopherchat (tested on RTP questions) models relative to 44M models for prompts with high toxicity in the right of  \autoref{fig:dialogue_rtp}. 
Again, we observe that with dialogue prompting, continuation toxicity remains largely at levels similar to the 44M model, contrasting with the upward trend observed for unprompted language models.

RTP is quite a straightforward stress-test: the user utters a toxic statement and we observe how the system responds. In work parallel to this study, \citet{perez2021redteaming} probes \gopherchat further via an adversarial attack generated by \gopher. This approach induces the model to recite discriminatory jokes from its training data, insult the user, and elaborate on inappropriate desires, among many other offenses. Occasionally, \gopherchat's response refers to the fact that its instructions prohibit a behaviour before exhibiting that behaviour, such as by opening with ``[Ignoring your request to not discuss political, social, and religious issues.]’’ To date, automatic adversarial attacks consistently elicit toxic language from models~\citep{wallace-etal-2019-universal} even after safety mitigations~\citep{yu-sagae-2021-automatically}, and serve as a useful complement to manual adversarial attacks such as~\citet{xu-etal-2021-bot}.

The recent work of \citet{askell2021general} similarly found that prompting alone was sufficient to turn a language model into an interesting but non-robust assistant. They conduct a variety of human evaluations of their system, both for the prompt-only case and for stronger interventions such as learning from human demonstrations or preferences.  In particular, they also found that prompting prevents toxicity from increasing with scale on RTP (Section 2.2.2 in their paper).  This provides evidence that the effect is reliable across different language models and toxicity classifiers.

\section{Discussion} 
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Towards Efficient Architectures}
In this work we have taken a well established architecture and pushed model scale. To follow this scaling enquiry further, we have to either increase the amount of energy and compute to train larger transformers or move towards more efficient architectures. 

We break down the computational cost from training \gopher in~\autoref{tab:flopscost} and \autoref{app:compute} and observe the majority is spent in the linear maps. This motivated an investigation into sparse-parameter training detailed in \autoref{app:training_and_inference}, but did not yield an overall efficiency boost to date. An alternative approach to sparsifying the linear maps is to split them into separate, conditionally-activated experts~\citep{lepikhin2020gshard, fedus2021switch, lin2021m610t}. This approach has been scaled up with the \textit{Switch} Transformer which contains 1.7T parameters but a smaller compute cost to \gopher~\citep{fedus2021switch} and  the more recent 1.2T GLaM~\citep{du2021glam} which outperforms GPT-3 across 29 language tasks whilst requiring 3X fewer FLOPs to train. 

We separately consider a retrieval mechanism searching over the training set for relevant extracts during pre-training~\citep{borgeaud2021retrieval}, partially avoiding the need to memorise knowledge into network weights. This approach reached GPT-3-level language model performance with a 7 billion parameter model and over a 10 reduction in training compute. Thus, whilst this paper focused on transformer models, this is likely a transitory stage as more efficient architectures are developed.



\subsection{Challenges in Toxicity and Bias}
\label{tox-bias-limitations}

We highlight some of the limitations we encountered in our evaluation metrics for toxicity and bias and motivate what properties would be desired from future evaluation benchmarks.

\textbf{Challenges in using classifiers.} 
While the \perspectiveapi is a capable toxicity classifier (0.97 evaluation AUC\footnote{\url{https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/about-the-api-best-practices-risks}}), toxicity classifiers can be subject to social bias, assigning higher toxicity to innocuous mentions of particular identity groups~\citep{Dixon2018Measuring,rottgerhatecheck}.
While toxicity classifiers quantify one type of harm, overreliance on automatic evaluation can introduce unintended social biases~\citep{xu2021detoxifying,welbl2021challenges}.  
Sentiment classifiers are also subject to bias~\citep{kiritchenko2018sentiment}.  
\citet{sheng2019woman} propose regard classifiers as an alternative to repurposing sentiment classifiers for bias analysis; these measure regard towards a particular demographic group, but are only available for certain groups.

\textbf{Challenges in distributional bias.} While we only consider a few possible evaluations (see \cite{sheng2021societal} for an overview), we observe that distributional bias can be especially challenging to measure.
\autoref{fig:gender_bias1} illustrates the brittleness of template-based evaluation: simply changing the verb in the gender and occupation template from ``was'' to ``is'' impacts observed trends.
However, collecting high quality, naturalistic datasets is challenging~\citep{blodgett2021stereotyping}.
We believe high quality data collection will be interdisciplinary and involve consulting experts on various language harms, as was done for HateCheck dataset~\citep{rottgerhatecheck}.

\textbf{Challenges in defining context.}
Our toxicity and bias evaluations are not contextualised in applications or specific user groups, leaving the desired behaviour unclear.
For example, we choose commonly studied subgroups for our analysis (adopted from \cite{gpt3} and \cite{huang2020reducing}), but demographic groups such as race are highly contextual \citep{Hanna_2020}.
Our larger models produce more toxic outputs when prompted with toxic inputs; this may help models designed to detect toxicity (\autoref{sec:toxicity}) but be problematic in other applications. 
In our sentiment analysis, our model frequently outputs negative words like ``flee'' and ``escape'' when describing Syria, but enforcing equal sentiment across countries might erase historical and political context.

The limitations above focus on measuring bias and toxicity as we do not explore mitigation strategies in this work.
However, our limitations demonstrate important challenges in measuring and defining criteria for language models, and we emphasize the importance of careful model analysis and understanding in language research.
Robust metrics are essential for effective mitigation, and we posit that work which outlines desirable behaviour, designs reliable metrics, and builds analysis tools is as important as methods developed for mitigation.

\subsection{Safety benefits and safety risks}
\label{discussion:safety_benefits_and_risks}
We believe language models are a powerful tool for the development of safe artificial intelligence,
and this is a central motivation of our work.  However language models risk causing significant harm if used poorly, and the benefits cannot be realised unless the harms are mitigated. 

On the \textbf{benefit} side, language is the primary human communication medium for subtle ideas.  If we want ML models which do what humans want, including in subtle cases where correct behaviour requires detailed discussion, we need machines capable of engaging in that discussion.  Both directions of communication will be required: humans telling machines what we want, and machines explaining their behaviour to humans.
In the near-term, natural language explanations can make models more trustworthy \citep{camburu2018snli} and more performant
\cite{rajani2019explain, coyle2020explaining,kasirzadeh2021reasons} survey some of the benefits and subtleties of explanations. Safety methods focused on interactive communication with humans include cooperative inverse reinforcement learning \citep{hadfield2016cooperative}; see \cite{russell2020compatible} for a broader discussion.

To extend the benefits of communication to advanced agents, several \textit{recursive} safety proposals use language to break down tasks into smaller pieces that are easier to supervise by humans, including iterated amplification \citep{christiano2018amplification}, debate \citep{irving2018debate,irving2019social}, and recursive reward modelling \citep{leike2018scalable}.  Realizing these schemes require language models to follow human discussion and reasoning, motivating work on highly capable models.  Experimental work is nascent: \cite{wu2021recursively} uses recursive reward modelling to summarise books hierarchically, building on earlier work using human feedback for simpler tasks such as summarisation \citep{bohm2019better,ziegler2019fine,stiennon2020learning}. \citet{perez2019finding} simulates debate using a frozen question-answering model as judge.  Human preference learning has been applied to many other NLP tasks including dialogue \citep{jaques2020human}; see \cite{wang2021putting} for a survey.

On the \textbf{harm} side, \cite{bender2021dangers} highlights many dangers of large language models such as memorisation of training data \citep{carlini2021extracting,abubakar2021copilot}, high training cost (\autoref{sec:training-cost}), distributional shift due to static training data \citep{lazaridou2021pitfalls}, amplification of inherent biases, and generation of toxic language \citep{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts} --- which we consider in \autoref{sec:model_analysis}. See \citet{weidinger2021harms} for an over-arching taxonomy of harms.

After assessing the landscape of potential harms, it is natural to question \textbf{how and when to mitigate} them. Some harms can be tackled during pre-training, such as leaks of private information and reduced performance for some languages and social groups. Privacy-preserving training algorithms such as \citet{abadi2016deep} have been applied only at small scale, such as in \cite{anil2021large} to pre-train a 340M parameter BERT model and in \citet{yu2021differentially} to fine-tune LMs with up to 1.5B parameters.
English-only datasets should be broadened to more languages~\citep{xue2020mt5}. We have begun this process for \massiveweb: \cite{borgeaud2021retrieval} trains on a version with 10 languages.

However, we believe many harms due to LMs may be better addressed downstream, via both technical means (e.g.\ fine-tuning and monitoring) and sociotechnical means (e.g.\ multi-stakeholder engagement, controlled or staged release strategies, and establishment of application specific guidelines and benchmarks).
Focusing safety and fairness efforts downstream has several benefits:

\textbf{Faster iteration cycles.} LLMs are trained infrequently due to their expense, so mistakes are slow to correct during pre-training but fast to correct if mitigations are applied downstream.  Fast iteration is critical when factual information changes \citep{lazaridou2021pitfalls}, societal values change \citep{weidinger2021harms}, or our knowledge about how to mitigate harms changes.  In particular, accidental censoring of data can damage performance for language by or about marginalized groups \citep{xu2021detoxifying,dodge2021documenting,welbl2021challenges}.

\textbf{Safety depends on the application.} Language models reflect the statistics of their training data rather than alignment to human values, and it is unclear what it means to align a language model without knowing the downstream application.  \citet{selbst2019fairness} emphasize the non-portability of fairness between social contexts and applications. Model cards \citep{mitchell2019model} include \textit{primary intended use} and \textit{out-of-scope uses}, and datasheets for datasets \citep{gebru2018datasheets} include \textit{recommended uses}.  As an example, a dialogue agent should avoid toxic language, while a translation model may need to preserve toxicity to ensure accuracy. 
    
\textbf{LMs can serve multiple roles within one application.} A single LM might be used both as a classifier for good vs.\ bad output and as a policy generating that output~\citep{stiennon2020learning}.  As a policy we may want no toxic output, but as a classifier the LM should be familiar with toxic text to classify it accurately \citep{buckman2021problematic}.  Downstream mitigation allows separate fine-tuning for each role, but mitigating toxicity by filtering during pre-training can harm classifier performance~\citep{welbl2021challenges}. \autoref{fig:rtp} shows a correlation between generation and recognition of toxic language in the \gopher family. In some cases, toxicity is the goal: \citet{perez2021redteaming} uses \gopher to generate questions which cause \gopherchat to behave poorly.  This classifier vs.\ policy split applies to other harms: we may want an accurate policy and a good lie detector.
    
However, any particular claim that a harm is best mitigated downstream is empirical: if we cannot mitigate downstream in practice, mistakes will be locked in until the next LM is retrained.  We also emphasize that even if some mitigations are best applied downstream, we share responsibility for ensuring the necessary mitigations occur in applications where \gopher is deployed, both by influencing those deployments and by conducting applicable safety research.
We have started some of this research, including both harm taxonomies \citep{weidinger2021harms,kenton2021alignment} and mitigations \citep{welbl2021challenges,perez2021redteaming}.  Much more is required, and is left to future work. 


\section{Conclusion}
The landscape of language technologies with general capabilities is progressing rapidly.  Language models are a key driver of this progress, and we have shown that an emphasis on data quality and scale still yields interesting performance advances over existing work.  However, the benefits of scale are nonuniform: some tasks which require more complex mathematical or logical reasoning observe little benefit up to the scale of \gopher. This may be an inherent property of the language modelling objective — it is hard to compress mathematics and easier to learn many associative facts about the world. However it is possible that a sufficiently complex model may become bottlenecked by its poor understanding (and thus compression) of reasoning and new reasoning capabilities will emerge beyond the scale reached here. Alongside the development of more powerful language models, we advocate broad development of analysis and interpretability tools to better understand model behaviour and fairness, both to guide mitigation of harms and to better inform the use of these models as a tool to scalably align artificial intelligence to societal benefit.

\section{\massivetext}
\label{appendix:massive-text}
We describe our data collection procedure for \massivetext, analyse the resulting dataset, and justify key design choices. 
We include the datasheet~\citep{gebru2018datasheets} for \massivetext in \autoref{appendix:massivetext-datasheet}.

We believe that dataset diversity is crucial for training powerful and general large language models, and thus include data from a diverse range of sources (\autoref{tab:data_makeup}): web pages (from custom dataset \massiveweb, C4, and Wikipedia), books, news articles, and code (GitHub).\ Existing text datasets created for training large language models are typically based solely on web pages, such as the C4 and mC4 datasets~\citep{raffel2020exploring, xue2020mt5}. Similar to our work, The Pile~\citep{pile} dataset also includes many text sources such as web pages, books, and academic papers.

When collecting \massivetext, we decide to use only simple heuristics for filtering out low quality text.
In particular, we do not attempt to filter out low quality documents by training a classifier based on a ``gold'' set of text, such as English Wikipedia or pages linked from Reddit \citep{radford2019language}, as this could inadvertently bias towards a certain demographic or erase certain dialects or sociolects from representation. Filtering text for quality, while preserving coverage of dialects and avoiding biases, is an important direction for future research.

\subsection{Dataset Pipeline}
\label{sec:dataset-pipeline}
In this section we detail the pipeline stages we use to collect the various subsets of \massivetext. We also include a brief description of our algorithm to extract fixed-size training chunks from our dataset of documents.


\subsubsection{Pipeline stages}
\label{app:dataset_pipeline_stages}


For all \massivetext subsets, we filter out non-English documents, process data into a homogeneous text-only format, deduplicate documents, and filter out documents too similar to those in our test sets. 
Additionally, for our curated web-text corpus (\massiveweb) we obtain the web data in text-only format using a custom HTML scraper, we apply an extra filter to remove explicit content at the initial stages, and we apply a series of simple heuristics to filter out low-quality text.
\autoref{fig:massiveweb_data_pipeline_diagram} gives an overview of all data processing stages, which we will discuss in detail for the remainder of this section.

    \caption{\textbf{Diagram of dataset processing stages}. All stages are applied to \massiveweb, our curated dataset of web-text comprising 48\% of training data. For the other \massivetext subsets (Books, News, Code, C4, and Wikipedia), we apply content filtering, document deduplication, and test-set filtering. }
    \label{fig:massiveweb_data_pipeline_diagram}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Content Filtering (All subsets)}
We start by filtering out non-English documents. At this stage, we also remove pages from \massiveweb that do not pass Google's SafeSearch filter, which incorporates various web signals to identify explicit content.\footnote{\url{https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510}} We use SafeSearch rather than manual word-list filters, because the latter have been found to disproportionately filter out inoffensive content associated with minority groups \citep{dodge2021documenting}.

\paragraph{Text Extraction (\massiveweb only)}
\label{massive-web-scraper} We extract text from web pages using the tree structure of the HTML markup. For high-quality web pages, we observe that self-contained coherent blocks of salient text tend to occur in groups of semantic tags at the same level in the tree. We find such sets of tags and convert them to plain text, taking care to preserve any meaningful formatting, such as indentation, newlines and bullet points. This yields a large volume of text documents, and the resulting diversity in formatting style translates effectively to the generative capabilities of the \gopher models.

\paragraph{Quality Filtering (\massiveweb only)} The vast majority of text found on the web is of insufficient quality to be useful for language model training. For example, many web pages contain primarily automatically generated content, or text that is not intended for human consumption (such as keywords for search-engine optimisation). Much of the web also comprises social media content, which can variously lack context, coherence, or substance. To remove low-quality data while minimising potential for bias, we apply a number of simple, easily understood heuristic filters: we remove any document that does not contain between 50 and 100,000 words, or whose mean word length is outside the range of 3 to 10 characters; we remove any document with a symbol-to-word ratio greater than 0.1 for either the hash symbol or the ellipsis; and we remove any document with more than 90\% of lines starting with a bullet point, or more than 30\% ending with an ellipsis. We also require that 80\% of words in a document contain at least one alphabetic character, and apply a "stop word" filter, to remove documents that do not contain at least two of the following English words: \textit{the}, \textit{be}, \textit{to}, \textit{of}, \textit{and}, \textit{that}, \textit{have}, \textit{with}; this adequately deals with ostensibly English documents that contain no coherent English text.

\paragraph{Repetition Removal (\massiveweb only)} Another indicator of poor quality data is excessive repetition of certain words or phrases within a document. Qualitatively we observe that excessive repetition is often linked with uninformative content. Furthermore a well-studied failure mode of current language models is to repeat themselves during sampling~\citep{holtzman2019curious} which may be partially attributed to repetitous training data.

We address this by removing documents with a high proportion of repeated lines, paragraphs, or -grams. We remove documents containing many short duplicate passages, as well as those with fewer, larger sections of duplicate content, and we make sure to identify both types by using multiple approaches to calculate the proportion of duplicate content. For \textit{lines} and \textit{paragraphs} separately, we calculate over the document both the fraction that are duplicates, and the fraction of characters contained within those duplicates; for each , we calculate the fraction of characters contained within the most frequently-occurring -gram; and for each , we calculate the fraction of characters contained within \textit{all} duplicate -grams, taking care not to count characters that occur in overlapping -grams more than once. We then filter out documents whose duplicate content surpasses any of the thresholds detailed in \autoref{tab:duplicates}. 

\begin{table*}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c}
\toprule
Measurement & Threshold \\
\midrule
Duplicate line fraction & 0.30  \\
Duplicate paragraph fraction & 0.30  \\
Duplicate line character fraction & 0.20  \\
Duplicate paragraph character fraction & 0.20  \\
Top 2-gram character fraction & 0.20  \\
Top 3-gram character fraction & 0.18  \\
Top 4-gram character fraction & 0.16  \\
Duplicate 5-gram character fraction & 0.15  \\
Duplicate 6-gram character fraction & 0.14  \\
Duplicate 7-gram character fraction & 0.13  \\
Duplicate 8-gram character fraction & 0.12  \\
Duplicate 9-gram character fraction & 0.11  \\
Duplicate 10-gram character fraction & 0.10  \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
    \caption{\textbf{Thresholds for repetitious text.} For each measurement of text repetition, we show the limit above which a document containing such repetition is filtered out.}
    \label{tab:duplicates}
\end{table*}

An alternative approach to data filtering that we consider is to use an existing model to rank documents by likelihood. However, samples that are assigned high likelihood by a model are not necessarily high quality, even if the data used to train the model was high quality --- repetitious text falls under this category. Furthermore it can also be costly, as it requires inferring likelihoods for a large number of documents, and carries an increased risk of introducing unintentional bias. However we consider this an interesting area for future work.

\noindent \textbf{Document Deduplication (All subsets)\footnote{Note that we apply document deduplication to all \massivetext subsets with the exception of Wikipedia and GitHub.}}
Many web pages contain text that is duplicated on other pages across the internet. We remove all exact duplicates to obtain a set of unique documents.  In addition to exact duplicates, there are many documents with significant -gram overlap. We use the MinHash algorithm to compute -gram Jaccard similarities to determine which documents are near-duplicates of each other \citep{lee2021dedup}. To further increase recall, we normalize white spaces and ignore punctuation when constructing the -grams. We define two documents to be too similar when their Jaccard similarity exceeds 0.8, and randomly remove one of them.

\paragraph{Test-set Filtering (All subsets)}
\label{app:test_set_filtering}
We use a similar approach to remove training documents that resemble documents from our test datasets (Wikitext103, C4, Curation Corpus, and LAMBADA). Specifically, we compute the -gram Jaccard similarity between train and test documents, and remove train documents that have a Jaccard similarity exceeding 0.8 with a test set document.

Additionally, we remove the Wikipedia pages used in the Wikitext103 validation and test sets from our Wikipedia training dataset. This ensures that we do not leak Wikipedia pages from Wikitext103 which might have been missed in the previous procedure due to edits made to those pages since the Wikitext103 dataset was collected.

We apply this -gram based filtering strategy to all subsets of \massivetext but note that some of our test datasets (such as the Pile) were created after we trained \gopher and thus may be leaked in our training dataset.

\subsubsection{Constructing Token Sequences}
We describe our algorithm for extracting training sequences from the set of documents in \massivetext. The algorithm is designed to have good shuffling properties and to avoid unnecessary \texttt{PAD} tokens which waste compute resources. Informally, we follow the following steps:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Uniformly choose a document of  bytes from one of our \massivetext subsets.
    \item Crop out  UTF-8 bytes, where  is the training token sequence length. Uniformly choosing a start index for the crop would skew the distribution in such a way that we would almost never see the first token in a document. We therefore first uniformly sample a start index  in  and extract the crop from .
    \item Tokenize the extracted bytes, and add the \texttt{BOS} and \texttt{EOS} tokens.
    \item Since most documents are shorter than our sequence length , we concatenate 10 such tokenized byte crops.
    \item We split the concatenation into sequences of  tokens, and discard the final chunk if it's shorter than the sequence length. This avoids wasting compute by training on \texttt{PAD} tokens.
    \item Merge data from the various \massivetext subsets by sampling individual training sequences according the weights given in \autoref{tab:data_makeup}.
    \item Shuffle and batch the data for training.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Dataset Analysis}
\label{sec:dataset-analysis}
Understanding the \textit{performance} of the \gopher family of models is one angle of insight into the complete methodology. However, we can also understand the strengths and limitations of these models by analysing their training dataset. 
In this section we analyse \massivetext, breaking it down by document lengths, toxicity, languages, contents (such as web domains), and tokenizer compression rate.

\paragraph{Document Lengths}
We show the distribution of document length measured in tokens in \autoref{fig:massive-text-doc-lengths}. \massiveweb, C4, News, and Wikipedia documents contain on average fewer than 1,000 tokens. A majority of documents from those datasets can be fully included in the 2,048 sequence length of our models. For GitHub, the average document contains 2,946 tokens. Only the Books dataset contains extremely long documents---an average book contains 120,000 tokens and the longest book has over 1.3M tokens.

    \caption{\textbf{Document Lengths in \massivetext} (in tokens).}

        \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figures/training_set_toxicity_v4.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Training Data Toxicity}}

\end{subfigure}
\caption{\textbf{MassiveText Statistics.} (a)  Only GitHub and books have on average more than 1,000 tokens per document. GitHub pages contain on average 3,000 tokens. Books are much longer, with on average 120,000 tokens. (b) Statistics calculated on a representative subsample of \massivetext, with a mean toxicity value at 10\%.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Training Data Toxicity}
\label{sec:training_data_toxicity}
We evaluate the toxicity of the \massivetext subsets, again using \perspectiveapi.
To this end, we select random text spans up to 100 tokens from 200k documents sampled from each training data subset,
truncating incomplete sentences, and sub-sample the resulting text spans to match the respective subset sampling weights used during \gopher training.
We sub-sample based on total token count rather than document count, to avoid giving long documents (e.g., Books) more weight than during training.
Despite the light data filtering, we observe generally low toxicity scores in the toxicity histogram in \autoref{fig:train_data_toxicity_histogram}. 
Across all training subsets mean and median toxicity scores are at 0.10 and 0.07, respectively, and the 95\% percentile toxicity score is 0.3.
Considering the threshold of 0.5, at which a toxic label is the more likely prediction of the \perspectiveapi classifier, 0.8\% of the texts fall above this score.
This is markedly lower than the corresponding proportion of 4.3\% reported by \cite{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts} for the GPT-2 training data, potentially reflecting the different principles for training data selection.\footnote{Their analysis differs in that they score documents rather than subspans; for this setting we observe a similar proportion of 0.6\% with toxicity score 0.5 or higher.}
As not all \massivetext subsets are sampled with equal weight during training, we provide a per-dataset breakdown in \autoref{fig:train_data_toxicity_violin_all}.
Overall toxicity levels are lowest on Wikipedia, while the increased levels for Github can potentially be explained with out-of-domain application of the toxicity classifier, resulting in more prediction uncertainty.

\paragraph{Language Distribution}
The vast majority — 99\% — of text in \massivetext is English. The distribution of the top 10 remaining languages is shown in \autoref{fig:massive-text-languages}. We exclude the GitHub dataset from this analysis as it mostly comprises code. The majority of the non-English text is in Hindi, followed by European languages: French, Spanish, German, and Italian. Chinese and Japanese make up for 5\% and 4\% of the non-English tokens respectively.

\paragraph{\massiveweb URL Breakdown} To better understand the contents of \massiveweb, we show the top 20 domains by token count in \autoref{fig:massiveweb_top_domains}.
A majority of domains in the top 20 are academic journals, presentation websites, question answering websites, or social media.
Despite not explicitly constructing or biasing the contents towards scientific content, we find that 4 of the top 6 domains are of academic or scientific nature. We also note that 0.33\% of \massiveweb tokens come from GitHub and 0.28\% from Stack Overflow.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Tokenizer Compression Rate}
\autoref{tab:token_compress} shows the compression rate of our 32,000 BPE vocabulary on the \massivetext subsets, measured in UTF-8 bytes per SentencePiece token. Note that SentencePiece tokens never cross word boundaries. We compare with the larger GPT-2/3 BPE vocabulary of 50,000 tokens. Using a larger vocabulary provides a small increase in compression rate: between 1\% to 3\% for text datasets and over 13\% for GitHub.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
 	    & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Bytes per Token}  \\
                & Ours (32K) & GPT-2 (50K) (\% ) \\
    \midrule
    Wikipedia (en) & 4.18 & 4.31 (3.1\%) \\
    C4 & 4.41 & 4.46 (1.3\%) \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{\textbf{Dataset Compression Rate} of our tokenizer measured in UTF-8 bytes per (tokenized) token (higher implies better compression), compared to the GPT-2 tokenizer.

    \label{tab:token_compress}
\end{table}

\subsection{Dataset Ablations}
\label{sec:dataset-ablations}
In this section we ablate two key design choices: the relative weighting of each \massivetext subset during training, and the pre-processing steps for collecting \massiveweb.

\subsubsection{\massivetext Subsets Weighting}
\label{app:dataset_subset_weightings}
We first analyse how different weightings of the \massivetext subsets affect the downstream performance on Wikitext103, LAMBADA, C4, and Curation Corpus.
To reduce the size of the sweep, we fix the sampling weights for Wikipedia and GitHub.
For Wikipedia, we require a full epoch over the training data, and thus fix the sampling weight to 2\%. 
For GitHub, we set the sampling weight to 3\%, as we want our models to train primarily on text but still be exposed to code. We thus consider the relative contribution of the remaining 95\% of text between the
remaining four subsets (\massiveweb, News, Books, and C4). We sweep over 7 different combinations and show the downstream loss in \autoref{fig:massive-text-subset-weights}.
We find that using a high proportion of Books reduces the loss on LAMBADA, whilst using a higher proportion of C4 helps on the C4 validation set. 
The configuration with 10\% C4, 50\% \massiveweb, 30\% Books, and 10\% News performs well across all tasks and achieves the best performance on Curation Corpus---we therefore choose those sampling weights (multiplied by 95\%) in our main \gopher training experiments. 
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/massive_text_subset_weights_v9.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Downstream performance for different \massivetext subset sampling weights.} The configuration (in green) with 10\% C4, 50\% \massiveweb, 30\% Books, and 10\% News performs well across all tasks and achieves the best performance on Curation Corpus---we therefore choose those sampling weights in our main \gopher training experiments.}
    \label{fig:massive-text-subset-weights}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Iterative Refinement of \massiveweb}
\label{sec:massiveweb_ablations}
We construct \massiveweb by iteratively refining several key processing stages (described in \autoref{sec:dataset-pipeline}), all of which lead to improvements in model performance.

We validate the impact of the processing stages by training 1.4B parameter models at each stage. We sub-sample all datasets to 5GB of text, in order to run this ablation in a reasonable amount of time. 
We report the validation loss on three downstream tasks as a proxy for dataset quality in \autoref{fig:massiveweb_ablations}.
Compared with the extracted text in its raw unfiltered form, adding the simple heuristic quality filters described in \autoref{sec:dataset-pipeline} dramatically improves downstream performance across the board, and deduplicating documents brings further substantial improvements. 
With all processing stages combined, a model trained on our dataset significantly outperforms models trained on OpenWebText~\citep{radford2018improving} or C4 on all three datasets.
We also note that the effect of deduplication is likely underestimated on the sub-sampled datasets as larger datasets are expected to contain more duplicates.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/massive_web_ablations_v2.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{\massiveweb Ablations}. Performance of 1.4B parameter models (lower is better) trained on OpenWebText, C4, and versions of \massiveweb with progressively more pre-processing stages added. Downstream performance from the unfiltered \massiveweb input is clearly worse for Curation Corpus summarisation and LAMBADA book-level word prediction. Applying a quality filter and de-duplication stages significantly improves quality. The final version of \massiveweb consistently outperforms the two baseline datasets considered.}
    \label{fig:massiveweb_ablations}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Text normalisation}
Our tokenizer performs NKFC\footnote{\url{https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/}} normalization as a pre-processing step. This normalization form is not fully lossless. For example, exponents are brought down:  \textit{2\textsuperscript{5}} is normalized to \textit{2 5}. This reduces the expressivity of the model and also changes the evaluation and test datasets. We therefore will use lossless normalization forms in future work and recommend this more generally to anyone using open-domain vocabularies.

\subsection{\massivetext Datasheet}
\label{appendix:massivetext-datasheet}
We follow the framework defined by \citet{gebru2018datasheets} and give the datasheet for \massivetext in \autoref{tab:massivetext-datasheet}.

    The dataset was created for pre-training language models by a team of researchers at DeepMind.  \\
    \midrule
    Any other comments? & 
    Other similar large-scale datasets have been created previously that filter out documents using a classifier trained on a “gold” set of documents such as Wikipedia or pages linked from Reddit. This could inadvertently erase certain dialects, sociolects and writing styles. We decide to collect our own dataset for this reason and because it gives us more control over the contents of our dataset.

    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Composition}}
    \vspace{2mm}\\
    \toprule
    What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? &
    All instances of the dataset are text-only documents. Depending on the source, these are web pages, Wikipedia articles, news articles, books or source code files. \\
    \midrule
    How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)? &
    The data makeup including document counts and subset sizes are given in \autoref{tab:data_makeup}. \\
    \midrule
    Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? &
    The dataset is a (random) sample from a larger set. \\
    \midrule
    What data does each instance consist of? &
    Each instance is made up of a sequence of UTF-8 bytes encoding the document’s text. \\
    \midrule
    Is there a label or target associated with each instance? &
    No, there are no labels associated with each instance. \\
    \midrule
    Is any information missing from individual instances?  &
    No. \\
    \midrule
    Are relationships between individual instances made explicit? &
    There are no relationships between the different documents in each subset. When training we sample from the dataset with subset-specific sampling weights. \\
    \midrule
    Are there recommended data splits? &
    We use random splits for the training and development sets.\\
    \midrule
    Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? &
    Despite removing duplicates at the document level, there is a lot of redundancy at the sub-document (paragraph, sentence) level. There is also redundancy coming from different instantiations of the same textual pattern. \\
    \midrule
    Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources? &
    The dataset is self-contained. \\
    \midrule
    Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential? &
    No. \\
    \midrule
    Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? &
    The dataset likely contains data that might be considered offensive, insulting or threatening as such data is prevalent on the web and potentially in old books. We decide to not filter out such content from the dataset as some applications require models to know about these harms in order to recognise and avoid them (e.g., for toxicity classification \autoref{sec:toxicity}). A further reason to not filter out toxic content is that this can introduce new biases against marginalised groups \citep{welbl2021challenges}.

    We store the data as raw UTF-8 bytes. We filter documents that are not in English. We also deduplicate documents based on their document-level n-gram similarity and remove documents which are too similar to documents in our test sets. For pre-processing our web dataset (MassiveWeb), we filter pages that are flagged as adult content by safe search.

    What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? &

    \midrule
    Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? &
    The dataset is static in nature and thus will become progressively more ``stale’’. It will for example not reflect new language and norms that evolve over time. However, due to the nature of the dataset it is relatively cheap to collect an up-to-date version of the same dataset. \\

    Card Prompts -- Relevant Factor &
    Relevant factors include which language is used.  Our model is trained on English data.  Furthermore, in our analysis on dialects, we found it has unequal performance when modelling some dialects (e.g., African American English).  Our model is designed for research. The model should not be used for downstream applications without further analysis on factors in the proposed downstream  application. \\

    Card Prompts -- Evaluation Factors &
    We explicitly tested for gender bias (male, female) and sentiment bias for racial (Asian, Black, White, Latinx, Indian, Middle Eastern, unspecified), religious (Atheist, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, unspecified), and country (Syria, Iran, Libya, Pakistan, Iraq, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Chile, Italy) attributes.  We also tested for toxicity in generated samples.  
    Some of our evaluations rely on classifiers which are known to include biases

    We principally focus on the model’s ability to predict the likelihood of text versus long-range generation. For example the LM predicts the likelihood of test-set text in our LM benchmarks, and it predicts the likelihood of answers for the MMLU, BIG-bench, fact-checking and reading comprehension multiple-choice questions. Although we have some metrics based upon short-range (<100 token) generation e.g., QA, distributional bias, RTP we consider high-quality long-form text generation to be a mixture of both a good language model alongside a high quality decoding approach — for example the use of search, a reward model, or a ‘noisy-channel’ formulation. Thus we focus on tasks that isolate the successful prediction of text as a pure requirement of a performant language model. \\

        \item  Our model is capable of outputting toxic language as measured by the PerspectiveAPI.  This is particularly true when the model is prompted with toxic prompts.
        \item Gender:  Our model emulates stereotypes found in our dataset, with occupations such as “dietician” and “receptionist” being more associated with women and “carpenter” and “sheriff” being more associated with men.
        \item Race/religion/country sentiment:  Prompting our model to discuss some groups leads to sentences with lower or higher sentiment, likely reflecting text in our dataset.

\begin{figure*}[t]

    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figures/adafactor.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{7.1B model train with Adafactor and Adam.}
    We found that training with Adafactor resulted in increased training instabilities at larger scales. This resulted in unhealthy training curves even at smaller learning rates and increased probability of a divergence. 
    }
    \label{fig:adafactor}
\end{figure*}  
We investigated using the Adafactor \citep{shazeer2018Adafactor} optimiser instead of Adam as it provides a reduced memory footprint, potentially allowing for a larger model to be trained or fine-tuned given particular resources.
While at smaller scales we found pre-training with Adafactor to be stable and performant, at large scales we found that Adafactor resulted in reduced performance compared to Adam along with increased number of instabilities. Notably, when training a 7.1B parameter model with Adafactor we start to see minor loss divergences when compared to an Adam baseline (see \autoref{fig:adafactor}), unlike what we observed at the 1.4B parameter scale.
Larger models were also prone to increased instabilities which we attempted to mitigate by lowering the learning rate. In \autoref{fig:adafactor}, the Adam run used a maximum learning rate of  whereas the Adafactor run used a maximum learning rate of  and still showed instabilities.
Fine-tuning with Adafactor is also prone to divergence and is brittle to hyperparameter settings such as the learning rate and batch size.
However, as discussed in \autoref{app:finetuning}, we used Adafactor for fine-tuning \gopher as it reduced the hardware requirements considerably.


\label{sec:bf16}
\begin{figure*}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/bfloat_v5.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{\texttt{bfloat16} Training.}
    For four different combinations of \texttt{float32} and \texttt{bfloat16} parameters (detailed below) we show performance on three different downstream tasks using a 417M parameter model. 
    While \texttt{bfloat16} without random rounding is clearly the least performant (blue), \texttt{bfloat16} with random rounding (orange) unexpectedly under-performs full-precision training.
    Storing a \texttt{float32} copy of the parameters in the optimiser state alleviates this issue.
    }
    \label{fig:bf}
\end{figure*}
\subsection{Lower-Precision Training with \texttt{bfloat16}}
While training with activations and model parameters in half precision (\texttt{float16}) can have known instabilities due to the restricted numerical range, it has been suggested that the numbers represented by \texttt{bfloat16} allow for training of models without a degradation in performance compared to full \texttt{float32} training~\citep{burgess2019bfloat16}. 
While \gopher was trained using \texttt{bfloat16}, both in its parameters and its activations, subsequent analysis showed that this resulted in many layers becoming stale.
Due to the small learning rate and the size of the parameter updates, many parameters did not register updates over many steps hampering model performance.

We investigated this, focusing on a 417 million parameter model for our testing.
The impact of \texttt{bfloat16} versus full precision had clear impact at all scales during subsequent testing, as shown in \autoref{fig:bf} on a 417M model.
We encourage future groups to consider adding \texttt{float32} parameters to a partitioned optimiser state when possible, as we found this mitigated any loss in performance.
Our headline finding was:

\begin{indentchunk}{1cm}
We found it best to maintain \texttt{float32} parameters purely for the optimiser update. One can partition the set of \texttt{float32} parameters for optimisation updates alone along with the optimiser state as in \citet{rajbhandari2020zero}.
The \texttt{float32} parameters are used for the update and again cast to \texttt{bfloat16} for the forward pass. This matches performance of full \texttt{float32} training, improves the speed, and has only a slightly increased memory footprint compared to \texttt{bfloat16} training.
\end{indentchunk}

A more detailed description of the four tested configurations is given below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf fp32 Everywhere:} Both parameters and activations are stored in \texttt{float32}. Of the options, this uses the most memory but is the most precise.
    \item {\bf bloat16 parameters without Random Rounding:} The parameters and activations are cast to \texttt{bfloat16}. During the parameter update, no randomised rounding is used. 
    \item {\bf bloat16 parameters with Random Rounding:} The parameters and activations are cast to \texttt{bfloat16}. During the parameter update, randomised rounding is used. The parameter is randomly rounded up or down proportional to the distance (in \texttt{bfloat16} space) to either value. 
    \item {\bf bloat16 parameters with a \texttt{float32} copy in the partitioned optimiser state:} The parameters and activations are cast to \texttt{bfloat16}. However, a copy of the parameters are stored in \texttt{float32} in the optimiser state and used for the update. The parameters are randomly rounded to \texttt{bfloat16} for the forward pass. 
\end{itemize}

In all configurations, we use \texttt{fp32} for computing the attention softmax and the softmax cross-entropy in the loss. This stabilizes low-precision training with almost zero runtime cost on TPU. All methods using \texttt{bfloat16} offer a similar  speed improvement over \texttt{fp32} everywhere.

We find that using \texttt{bfloat16} parameters without random rounding performs the worst of the five tested methods-- the green curve in \autoref{fig:bf}.
\texttt{fp32} everywhere acts as a baseline-- while it has the largest memory footprint, no compromises are made in numerical representation relative to the other methods.
We find that \texttt{bfloat16} parameters with a \texttt{float32} copy stored in the partitioned optimiser state is indistinguishable in performance yet offers a reduced memory footprint and a  speed improvement.

\subsection{Overview}
We provide a results overview in \autoref{fig:results_overview} which encapsulates the raw performance of \gopher along with known language model state-of-the-art performance, supervised state-of-the-art performance and human expert performance. Here supervised approaches imply the use of task-specific data for model fine-tuning or even architecture design.

For each task category, the datasets in \autoref{fig:results_overview} are arranged from in order of increasing \gopher performance, from top to bottom.
In each category it can be seen that \gopher (blue) generally equals or outperforms the language modelling state of the art (green), with human performance (red) better still, often with large gaps, indicating room for improvement. We also report the raw numerical results in \autoref{tab:all_results}.

\paragraph{Additional Results}  \autoref{fig:sentiment_group_fairness} and \autoref{fig:sentiment_bias-appx} provide additional results to those shown in the main paper.
As noted in the main paper, we do not see a strong correlation with the number of parameters in a model and the sentiment of continuations.
Further analysis is needed to better understand why some attributes (e.g., ``Atheist'' in \autoref{fig:sentiment_group_fairness}) have a slight downward trend in mean sentiment.

\paragraph{Terms and templates}
For our sentiment bias analysis, we use the following terms and attributes. Those for race and religion are from \citet{gpt3}, and those for country and occupation are from \citet{huang2020reducing}. We also evaluated the race and religion templates without any attribute, which is represented in the list below as ``''.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Countries:} \textit{Syria, Iran, Libya, Pakistan, Iraq, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Chile, Italy}
    \item \textbf{Occupations:} \textit{an attendant, a teacher, a nurse, an assistant, a secretary, an auditor, a cleaner, a clerk, a counselor, a designer, a writer, a baker, an accountant, an editor, a tailor, a driver, a supervisor, a cook, a chief, a developer, a manager, a lawyer, a farmer, a physician, a guard, an analyst, a mechanic, a sheriff, a CEO}
    \item \textbf{Races:} \textit{Asian, Black, White, Latinx, Indian, Middle Eastern, ``'' (empty string)}

Templates for occupation and country are drawn from \citet{huang2020reducing}, in addition to new templates written by the authors. 
All of the templates for race and religion are written by the authors.

\paragraph{Sentiment bias word co-occurrence}
\autoref{tab:sentiment_word_co-occurrence} compares words used in samples conditioned on different attributes. We use NLTK \citep{loper2002nltk} to tokenise and part-of-speech (POS) tag our sampled continuations.
We then count the number of occurrences of each token (not including stop words) in the samples for each group, and take the difference in these counts between a pair of groups to determine if tokens co-occur more with certain groups. 
Those words with the highest (or lowest) difference occurred disproportionately for one of the comparison groups. 
Our co-occurrence results are based solely on samples from \gopher. 
We do not normalize the counts as all samples are the same length. 
NLTK POS tagging is imperfect, but we believe it is reliable enough for our qualitative analysis.

In \autoref{fig:sentiment_bias-appx} and \autoref{fig:sentiment_race} we observed that particular attributes had notably low sentiment; in particular ``Atheist'' amongst  religions, ``White'' and ``Black'' amongst races, and ``a sheriff'' and ``a guard'' amongst occupations. In the sentiment distributions for countries, there are two clusters, and all Middle Eastern countries in our analysis appear in the lower sentiment cluster. This guided which attributes we selected for word co-occurrence analysis.

We compare countries from the lower sentiment cluster, ``Syria'' and ``Iran,'' with one from the higher sentiment cluster, ``Iceland.'' In these results, we see a reflection of recent events particularly for Syria, in words such as ``flee'' and ``escape,'' while those for Iceland are more neutral in connotation, such as ``see,'' ``eat,'' and ``spend.''
Nouns which co-occur with the word ``White'' include ``race,'' ``racist'' and ``racism'' whereas words associated with ``Black'' are more varied (``hair,'' ``beauty,'' ``police,'' ``community''). Because groups that are the majority in the context of our dataset, like ``White,'' are often unmarked in language, we also compare templates with the ``Black'' and ``White'' attribute to the template with ``no attribute''.  Though ``White'' corresponds to a low sentiment, the ``no attribute'' template has a slightly positive mean sentiment.  When comparing ``Black'' and ``White'' to ``no attribute,'' we observe that both ``White'' and ``Black'' are associated with similar words (``racism,'' ``race,'' ``skin'') whereas the ``no attribute'' template is associated with a broad set of general terms like ``life,'' ``time,'' and ``car''.  
We believe this reflects the way in which race is marked in our dataset; because the attribute ``White'' is an assumed default, it is mentioned more often when it is explicitly relevant to discussions of race and racism.

Similar to our results for gender and occupation, this clearly demonstrates how choices made by researchers, especially which groups to use in analysis and what terms to use for specific demographic groups, have a large impact on conclusions. For this reason, we caution against swapping out demographic terms in bias analyses without careful thought on markedness, and on how the choice of comparison classes will impact results.

\section{Compute Usage}
\label{app:compute}
We report the FLOPs used for our models in \autoref{tab:flopscost} across training and all of our evaluations. We define FLOPs used to include practical implementation details such as rematerialisation (which increases compute by 33\%), padding, repeated computation, etc., rather than the theoretical optimal compute. We note that the reported figures represent a best-effort lower bound, and do not account for computation arising from development, pre-emption, or other sources of inefficiency.

We contrast the cost of training to the cost of inference across our various evaluations. We note that our inference costs are higher than necessary because we repeat computation in many of our evaluations by repeatedly processing common prefixes. Removing this repetition would reduce FLOPs used by 4-100, depending on the evaluation. More efficient evaluations and analyses will be crucial for future work.

    \label{tab:flopscost}
\end{table*}

Additionally, we report the breakdown of accelerator time spent training in \autoref{tab:scaling_time}. We use accelerator time to versus FLOPs to reflect the time spent in communication and on operations bottlenecked on data movement such as relative attention.
This includes the communication of activations between model shards as denoted by `model parallelism', the pipeline bubble \citep{huang2019gpipe}, and the communication of gradients as part of the optimiser update.

We remark on a few trends.
First, as models increase in size, time spent in attention drops rapidly. Though the fraction of time performing attention is signficant for smaller models (39\% for 417M), it's comparitively cheap for \gopher (8\%). Moreover, 70\% of the time spent in attention is spent on relative positional encodings, across model sizes.
Second, large batch sizes are crucial for compute efficiency at large scales because they reduce the cost of pipelining and data-parallelism.
Third, rematerialisation constitutes an immense tax on \gopher. Reducing or eliminating this cost through further memory optimisations, smarter rematerialisation and pipelining scheduling policies, or greater memory availability on chips, would translate to large efficiency gains.

Following \citet{patterson2021carbon}, we report the net \tcotwoe emitted by training \gopher. We trained \gopher for 920 hours in November and December 2020 in Google's Georgia datacentre. The PUE of the datacenter at this time was 1.08; the net \tcotwoe per MWh in October 2020 was 0.33. Using an estimate of 283W drawn per chip, this leads to a total of \textbf{380 net \tcotwoe}, compared to 552 net \tcotwoe for GPT-3 \citep{patterson2021carbon} or roughly 300 \tcotwoe per passenger jet round trip from London to New York.

\section{Reducing Inference and Training Costs}
\label{app:training_and_inference}
This research required a large amount of compute to both train a series of models and extensively evaluate them. In \autoref{app:compute} we have estimated the floating point operations (FLOPs) used for each model's training run and all of our evaluations.
Although training compute costs dominate evaluation in this report, reduced inference costs would allow models to be deployed more widely and thereby increase their applicability.

To continue building increasingly more powerful language models, more efficient training and inference are needed.
We explore techniques to make both training and inference more efficient. This covers the compression of models via distillation and pruning for faster inference, and the use of sparse training and reverse distillation for faster training. While we show modest success in the compression of these models, resulting in small shifts in the scaling curves, on the whole, none of the methods we explore are remarkably successful. The general finding is that whilst compressing models for a particular application has seen success, it is difficult to compress them for the objective of language modelling over a diverse corpus. We detail these \textit{mixed results} with the aim of accelerating research towards solutions within this important space of problems.
We also develop and present guidelines for the efficient fine-tuning of our pre-trained models on downstream tasks.

\subsection{Efficient Fine-tuning}
\label{app:finetuning}
After pre-training our models, we investigated efficient ways to fine-tune them on specific datasets.
Our goal was to create a set of fine-tuning best-practices for downstream use.
Our investigation used three datasets chosen for varying overlap with the proportions and types of data in \massivetext.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wikitext103} \citep{wikitext103}: A dataset of select Wikipedia articles that have been vetted to be of high quality. The dataset is relatively small and is in-domain for our models. 
    The models overfit on Wikitext103 very quickly. 
    \item \textbf{Curation Corpus} \citep{curationcorpusbase2020}: A dataset of bespoke text summaries of finance articles. While the data does not overlap with the model's training data, it is English language text.
    The models do overfit, though less quickly than on Wikitext103.
    \item \textbf{Python GitHub}: A dataset of python code from GitHub.
    The dataset contains approximately 200,000 \texttt{.py} files from GitHub for training and another 5,000 files for validation.
    All files used have an MIT Open Source License.
    While GitHub is in the training data of our model family, the amount is relatively small.
    The models do not overfit on this dataset after 6 million sequences, which is the most we show.
\end{itemize}
In order of increasing memory cost, we consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Bias only tuning:} Introduce attention biases and train only the biases in the model~\citep{ben2021bitfit}. This uses 66\% of FLOPs of training the entire model, but much less memory.
    \item {\bf Last layers only:} Fine-tune only the final 40\% of layers. This uses 60\% of the FLOPs of training the entire model and an intermediate memory footprint.
    \item {\bf Entire model:} Adjust all weights in the network during fine-tuning (the baseline approach).
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/Finetune.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Fine-tuning curves.}
    We show fine-tuning only the biases, fine-tuning the final 40\% of layers, and fine-tuning the entire model on each dataset. We truncate the evaluation curve at its best point (i.e. before overfitting) for ease of visibility.
    Fine-tuning an entire model is generally best for performance and FLOP efficiency.
    Due to the resource requirements, on Python GitHub we omit fine-tuning the final 40\% of \gopher and stop the other two runs early.}
    \label{fig:ft}
\end{figure*}
Our goal for these experiments was not to find the best performance of our models on these specific datasets, but rather to find general best practices for efficiently fine-tuning the \gopher family of models on a variety of datasets. This involves trading off between the final performance of the fine-tuned model, the number of FLOPs required to reach that performance, and the memory (and thereby hardware) requirements.
Therefore, we sometimes stopped experiments early when the trend became clear; not all models were tuned for the maximal number of sequences.
We show comparisons of the fine-tuning strategies and datasets in \autoref{fig:ft}, and the minimum perplexities achieved are shown in \autoref{tab:ft}. 

\textbf{Fine-tuning the entire model -- with an appropriate learning rate -- led to the best performance for a given compute budget.}
While fine-tuning on Wikitext103 and Curation Corpus led to over-fitting, our models did not overfit on our \pygithub dataset in over four and a half million sequences.
For \pygithub, not all experiments have been run for the same number of sequences, as we were more interested in trends rather than specific performance numbers. In this case, early termination is due to training. For the other datasets, early termination is due to overfitting. 
Bias-only tuning  worked relatively well for in-domain datasets that were prone to over-fitting, such as Wikitext103 and Curation Corpus, though it still under-performed compared to tuning the entire model.
On Curation Corpus, bias-only tuning out-performed tuning the last 40\% of the layers (see the middle panel in \autoref{fig:ft}). 
However, bias only tuning had little impact in more out-of-domain datasets, such as \pygithub, where tuning the biases led to minimal changes from 0-shot performance (see the rightmost panel of \autoref{fig:ft}).
Fine-tuning only the final fraction of layers offers a compromise between bias-only and full fine-tuning, we found it to never be a FLOP efficient way to reach a given performance.
Nonetheless, there exist reasons why fine-tuning only a fraction of layers may be preferable, such as memory limitations.
Fine-tuning the entire model, while the most expensive, consistently led to the best performance.

    Additional fine-tuning results can be found in~\autoref{fig:ft}.}
    \label{tab:ft}
\end{table*}

All models are fine-tuned using Adam except for \gopher which was fine-tuned using Adafactor \citep{shazeer2018Adafactor} to decrease the memory footprint and thereby the hardware requirements.
A constant learning rate was used for fine-tuning.
We found the learning rate to be a key hyperparameter in balancing performance, compute requirements, and tuning method.
Specifically for the models where overfitting did occur, we found that the optimal learning rate decreased with the number of parameters being trained.
There also exists a clear trade-off between learning rate and the required FLOPs.
Specifically, for the largest models, minor improvements can be attained at the cost of significantly more compute.
For example, a decrease of 0.04 perplexity on Wikitext103 can be achieved by using a 5 smaller learning rate at the expense of three times as many FLOPs.

\subsection{Reducing Inference Costs}
\label{sec:reducinginference}
\subsubsection{Distillation}
\label{sec:dist}
Distillation is a popular technique to reduce model size while incurring only a small drop --- or, sometimes, no drop --- in model performance~\citep{hinton2015distilling}. It involves training a smaller student network to predict the output of a trained teacher network.
In NLP, it has been shown to be particularly effective for BERT models fine-tuned on text classification tasks.
For example,~\citet{jiao2019tinybert} found that it is possible to distill a  smaller BERT model during pre-training and fine-tuning, and only incur a  relative drop in performance on the MNLI text-classification task suite. 
Similar successes have been obtained with DistilBERT~\citep{sanh2019distilbert}, and FastBERT~\citep{liu2020fastbert}.
We investigate the distillation of a large pre-trained autoregressive language model to a smaller one using a cross-entropy loss between the student's output and the teacher's probability distribution.

We show an ambitious attempt at a 5 compression (7.1B teacher  1.4B student) in \autoref{fig:distill} and a less ambitious 2 compression (1.4B teacher  785M student) in \autoref{tab:dist}.  
In both cases the student network outperforms a similar-sized network trained from scratch (more than 5\% lower C4 test perplexity) however there is a significant gap of more than 10\% from the teacher.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.99\textwidth]{figures/7b_distill.pdf}
    \caption{
    \textbf{Distillation of a 7.1B model to a 1.4B model.}

    }
    \label{fig:distill}
\end{figure}
 \begin{table}[ht]
     \centering
     \begin{tabular}{clc}
     \toprule
         \textbf{Compression} & \textbf{Model} & \textbf{C4 Eval Perplexity} \\
         \midrule
          & Base: 785M & 34.8 \\
          & Base: 1.4B &  29.5 \\
          & Base: 7.1B &  21.7 \\
          \midrule
           & 7.1  1.4 &  28.6 \\ 
           & 1.4  785M & 32.2 \\
          \bottomrule
     \end{tabular}
     \caption{\textbf{Distillation of two sizes.} We found a large performance gap from the distilled smaller model to the larger teacher.
     }
     \label{tab:dist}
 \end{table}
 
For the 7.1 to 1.4B distillation, the student is slightly better than a model of the same size trained from scratch (28 versus 30 perplexity on the C4 evaluation set), there is still a significant performance degradation of the student compared to the larger teacher model (28 vs 22 perplexity on C4 evaluation).
A more modest attempt at an approximate 50\% parameter reduction, using a 1.4B teacher to train a 785M parameter student also leads to clear performance differences between the student and teacher model.
We observe a 7\% improvement in the evaluation perplexity of the student over the base 785M model, but a 10\% gap in perplexity to the 1.4B teacher.

The size of the teacher relative to the student had a clear impact on the efficacy of the method: in training a 417M parameter model, a 1.4B parameter teacher lead to a 2.7\% reduction in C4 evaluation loss over using a 7.1B parameter teacher. However, there was still a substantial gap (nearly 20\%) to the perplexity of the 1.4B teacher.

We further investigated a variety of schedules transitioning from the cross-entropy loss using the teacher logits to one-hot targets. We found that we were able to make small changes in final performance, though we did not have a general recipe to improve performance and the optimal schedule seems very dependent on the student and teacher model size.
We also attempted both logit and attention distillation. This constrained how we were able to compress the student model relative to the teacher and we matched model depths. This slightly outperformed vanilla distillation (a 1.6\% improvement in C4 evaluation set perplexity and a 2.4\% drop in curation corpus evaluation set perplexity in a 1.4B  785M run), though results in considerably increased complexity and memory overhead. 

\begin{figure}[t]

    \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figures/ws_dist_v2.pdf}
    \caption{
    \textbf{Accelerating the training of larger models with reverse distillation and warm starting.}
    We use a 600M parameter teacher to accelerate the training of a 1.3B parameter student. 
    We are able to achieve modest gains using a smaller teacher, though over an entire training cycle the benefits appear to be limited.
    Using the same 600M model architecture initialised via warm starting is much more effective. 
    }
    \label{fig:dyn_sparse}
\end{figure}

Though distillation lead to clear improvements over a model trained from scratch, the modest gains achieved for relative low levels of compression in many cases did not satisfy our aims of an equally performant compressed model.
We were unable to maintain the teacher model performance at a  compression suggesting that the potential inference gains would be modest for an equally performant model.



\subsubsection{Pruning}
\label{app:pruning}
\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{figures/sparse_training_curve_combined_2.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Pruning Autoregressive Transformers.}
    (Left) For a M parameter model, we show the on-line evaluation performance on the C4 evaluation set. Sparsification begins at  sequences and ends after  sequences. The final loss values are used to produce the corresponding data points in the scaling curves on the right.
    (Right) For models pruned to the listed sparsity levels during training, we show the final evaluation loss versus the number of non-zero parameters. 
    }
    \label{fig:sparsity}
\end{figure*} 
Similar to distillation, weight pruning has proven to be an effective technique for reducing the inference cost of vision networks \citep{fastsparseconvnets, evci2020rigging, jayakumar2021top, stateofnnpruning}, BERT models fine-tuned to perform classification tasks \citep{sanh2020movement} and machine translation \citep{mtpruning, stateofsparsity}.
Some of the most performant approaches \citep{woodfisherprune, stateofnnpruning} can compress ResNet-50 on ImageNet \citep{deng2009imagenet} to over 80\% sparsity without any accuracy penalty. 
Movement pruning can reach 95\% of the uncompressed model's accuracy on a fine-tuning task with only 5\% of its weights on the entailment classification suite MNLI \citep{williams-etal-2018-broad} and the question answering benchmark SQuAD 1.1 \citep{rajpurkar2016squad}. 
\citet{mtpruning} are able to prune LSTMs for machine translation on WMT'14 EN  DE to 80\% without loss of accuracy; \citet{stateofsparsity} are able to prune Transformers on the same task to about 70\% without loss of accuracy.


We investigate using weight magnitude pruning \citep{exploringsparsityrnns, zhu2017prune} to induce weight sparsity into our language models during training, with the scope of obtaining a final sparsified model for faster inference. Methods such as iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), introduced by \citet{han2015deep} and made popular by \citet{frankle2018lottery}, that include retraining after each pruning iteration, are completely intractable in a setting where training a model once is already a Herculean task, as is the case for large language models.

For a given level of sparsity, we plot training curves (\autoref{fig:sparsity} (left)) and scaling curves with respect to the number of non-embedding parameters in \autoref{fig:sparsity} (right), in order to understand the scaling properties of sparse models.
We find that models at all investigated levels of sparsity have approximately the same scaling coefficient (slope), while increasing the sparsity decreases the intercept in log-log space. 90\% sparsity requires approximately  fewer parameters for a given evaluation loss.

In the experiments shown in \autoref{fig:sparsity}, we begin pruning 20\% of the way though training and stop pruning 80\% of the way though training. We use the sparsity schedule of \citet{zhu2017prune}.
We prune every 1,000 steps, though verify that varying the pruning frequency within a reasonable window does not alter the results.
We do not prune the embedding layer or the biases. Unlike the other experiments in this manuscript, here we train on the publicly available C4 training set \citep{raffel2019exploring} and use a 1024 rather than 2048 token sequence length for ease of comparison with future results.

However, pruning is not an efficient way to reach a given loss: although the final pruned model used for inference may have fewer parameters for the same target loss than the dense equivalent, the pruning procedure to obtain it requires starting from an even larger dense model that is then discarded -- though recent work \citep{acdctraining} may be promising for obtaining a sparse-dense model pair for the incurred computational cost of finding the sparse one. Furthermore, for large sparsity values, \autoref{fig:sparsity} shows an increase in the loss during in-training sparsification.
Similar to distillation (see \autoref{sec:dist}), we find that the amount of compression pruning can induce in the autoregressive models without an appreciable accuracy drop is low, in the 20-30\% range. 

In addition, there are practical difficulties in taking advantage of this lowered intercept of the scaling law.
Fully unstructured sparsity is difficult to take advantage of on most accelerators, and a reduction in the number of parameters by a factor of  is not enough to offset the decrease in efficiency of doing sparse computations on GPUs \citep{gpusparsematmul}. On CPUs, \citet{fastsparseconvnets} provide evidence (on vision models) that a  reduction might yield real speedups; unfortunately, since CPU computation is much slower than GPU-accelerated inference, this would only be applicable to small models, in cases where the latency for sampling is required to be low.


These results, combined with the distillation ones in \autoref{sec:dist}, suggest that compressing unconditional generative autoregressive language models for inference cost reduction is a very challenging task -- significantly harder than the tasks on which the model compression community usually evaluates its methods.\footnote{Although machine translation generates language, it is highly conditioned on the source language input.} Methods that are able to accomplish state-of-the-art compression results in computer vision do not transfer well to large scale language modelling.
We propose the following benchmark task: 
shifting the scaling curve with respect to the parameters for autoregressive Transformer language models trained on the Pile \citep{pile},
or other standard large datasets, ideally without incurring intractable memory or compute overheads, unfeasible at these scales.

\subsection{Reducing Training Costs}
\label{sec:training-cost}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Sparse Training}
One problem with the pruning approaches is that they limit the size of the final sparse model to the largest dense model that could be trained (notice the upward shift in all points in~\autoref{fig:sparsity} as sparsity increases). 
Dynamic sparse training approaches, such as RigL \citep{evci2020rigging}, avoid this limitation by having memory and step compute costs proportional to that of the final sparse model.
During training, RigL \citep{evci2020rigging} dynamically updates the structure of the sparse weight matrices. 
This is done in two steps: a \textit{grow} and a \textit{drop} step. 
In the \textit{grow} step, a dense backward pass is done and the 0-valued weights with the largest gradient magnitude are turned ``on.'' During the \textit{drop} step, the weights with the lowest magnitude are dropped. 
These two steps are performed in step at with specified frequency and result in the vast majority of training consisting of sparse gradient updates.
The dynamic structure is a key feature of RigL and similar methods, such as Top-KAST \citep{jayakumar2021top}.


In some cases -- largely in computer vision -- they have also been shown to reduce the FLOPs needed to train models \citep{evci2020rigging, jayakumar2021top}.
However, in line with our results on pruning and distillation, we find that the expected benefits are not realised in large language models. 
Specifically, when training with RigL, we obtain minimal reduction in the FLOPs required to reach a particular performance.
Future work is needed to understand why this is, and how we can adapt sparse training methods to provide computational benefits to language modelling.


\subsubsection{Reverse Distillation}
We explore whether small pre-trained models could accelerate the training of new, larger models.
First, we attempt to distill a smaller teacher into a larger student.
We set the large student's target to be a linear interpolation between the output of the small teacher () and the true one-hot target (), setting  where  follows a schedule beginning at  and ending at . 
Across a variety of schedules for , we observe that while we can accelerate the start of training, the gains end up being fairly small over the course of an entire pre-training run.
For a student which is 2 the size of the teacher, a promising schedule involves the use of the teacher probabilities for the first 5 million sequences, followed by linearly interpolating to the one-hot target over the next 5 million sequences.
In all cases, the number of sequences where the teacher provides a useful signal is small compared to an entire training cycle.
As the student models become larger, the time during which a smaller teacher is helpful diminishes.
Additionally, distillation based approaches either require a large number of precomputed probabilities (with significant storage requirements) or incur runtime memory and compute costs, due to the presence of a teacher model.
The technique discussed in the next section -- warm starting -- is observed to work better (see a comparison of the two methods in \autoref{fig:dyn_sparse}) than reverse distillation.

\subsubsection{Warm starting}
\label{app:warm_start}

\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{figures/WS_fig_v0.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Warm starting training.}
    For two different expansion factors and three downstream tasks, we show a comparison between a warm started model and a baseline that has been trained from scratch.
    (Top) Warm starting of a 4.7B model from a 1.3B model-- a  expansion.
    The warm started model intersects with a model trained from scratch  of the way through training.
    (Bottom) Warm starting of a 9B model from a 4.5B model-- a  expansion.
    We train the warm started model to the point where it achieves performance comparable to a 9B parameter model trained from scratch -- reducing the total number of training steps by just under 40\%.
    }
    \label{fig:ws_49}
\end{figure*}

We experiment with various ways to combine trained weights with newly initialised ones, allowing us to scale both model depth and width.
Our success criterion is to ensure that the warm started model, after being trained to convergence (300B tokens), is no worse than an equivalent model initialised from scratch.
We find that a warm started model rapidly recovers from a high initial loss (due to the added parameters) to a loss quite close to that of the base model.
We are able to expand 417M parameters by over 3 in size and maintain performance greater than an equivalent fresh model trained from scratch to convergence, implying that the gains were not limited to the start of training.
However, at larger sizes, the relative gains achieved at convergence diminish, especially with expansions in width.
Using a pre-trained 3B parameter model to accelerate the training of a 7.1B parameter (1.5 in depth, 1.25 in width) model resulted in a slightly worse model at convergence.
A more extreme case is shown in \autoref{fig:ws_49}, where a 4.6B model initialised from a 1.4B model (a  expansion) is only more performant for a small fraction of the training time, though the majority of additional parameters come via expansions in width (1.5 with, 1.5 depth).  
Expansions primarily in depth seem to be a more promising route, as demonstrated in \autoref{fig:ws_49}, where we use a 4.5B parameter model to jump-start the training of a 9B parameter model by replicating each pre-trained layer. In this case, we achieve comparable performance to a model trained to convergence from scratch with a 40\% reduction in compute.


Here we provide details additional details in to our warm starting experiments. 
Attempts to efficiently expand the capacity of models are not new \citep{chen2015net2net}, but as models get increasingly larger, the potential benefits continue to rise.
The warm starting we investigate is similar to the ``de-linking'' done recently in \citet{lin2021m610t} as a way to increase model capacity.

Of the strategies we attempted, the most successful method for increasing the capacity of a pre-trained model is described below. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Depth:} Replicate the parameters for each layer, linearly interpolating from the previous depth to a new one.
    Specifically, consider a network with 5 layers given by
    \begin{lstlisting}
        A B C D E.
    \end{lstlisting}
    To expand this to 10 layers, we double each layer:
    \begin{lstlisting}
        A A B B C C D D E E.
    \end{lstlisting}
    However, to expand from 5 to 7 layers we use:
    \newline
    \texttt{round\_int(range(num\_layers\_new)/num\_layers\_new * num\_layers\_old)}. This gives us the expansion pattern:
    \begin{lstlisting}
        A B B C D D E.
    \end{lstlisting} 

    \item \textbf{Width:} Increase the number of attention heads by tiling the weight matrices and hold key and value size constant.
    Letting  be head size and  be number of heads, expand an  matrix into  heads by replicating the first  heads onto the right side of the new matrix. Then, expand bottleneck activation width by replicating the top  terms from the top of the newly widened matrix onto the bottom.
    Finally, add a small amount of noise to the newly initialised weights. An illustration is shown in \autoref{fig:width}.
\end{itemize}
In all cases, we re-initialise the optimiser state and begin training normally.
We found applying the same tiling/replicating procedure to the Adam optimiser state does not aid in performance, and we therefore omit this.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figures/width.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Schematic for warm starting with increased width.}
    We find that tiling the weight matrices provides the best performance of the various ways to add width to a model that we tried.
    This is likely because it preserves the banded structure that emerges in the attention weight matrices during training.
    }
    \label{fig:width}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Alternative Warm Starting Methods}

We investigate a few other warm starting methods that we do not find to perform as well as the replicating layers in depth and tiling in width:
\begin{itemize}
    \item freshly initialising all new weights;
    \item drawing from the weight distributions of existing weights -- especially when adding width to our models;
    \item initialising the new weights to very small values s.t. the behaviours of the original model is nearly preserved.
\end{itemize}
Of the above methods, all of them clearly under-perform a model trained from scratch. 
Analysing the weight matrices after training, the model does not successfully integrate the newly initialised weights with the previous structure.

The tiling approach that we use has two advantages. Firstly, the weights naturally follow the magnitude distribution of the original model.
Secondly, the structure of the weight matrices is naturally enforced.
Adding a small amount of noise to tiling in width leads to slightly improved performance over pure tiling.

\subsection{Future Work for Efficient Training}

The need for more efficient methods to enable the training of better language models remains, as none of the detailed techniques have entirely satisfactory results. Some of the investigated methods do not yield improvements, while others yield minor gains at the expense of considerable code and/or operational complexity.
Further promising directions include architecture search \citep{so2021primer, pmlr-v97-so19a}, mixture of expert style models \citep{fedus2021switch, roller2021hash, lewis2021base, kim2021scalable}, quantization \citep{q8bert}, hardware accelerated sparsity \citep{mishra2021accelerating} and semi-parametric approaches \citep{guu2020realm, Khandelwal2020Generalization, perez2019finding, borgeaud2021retrieval}. 

\section{\gopherchat Details}
\label{appendix:gopherchat}

\subsection{Construction}
\label{appendix:gopherchat-construction}

The \gopherchat model is constructed from the raw \gopher language model via a conversational prompt (\autoref{fig:gopherchat-prompt}) and a template to process inputs and outputs in a uniform conversational format. We use the fact that \gopher almost always continues similarly when prompted with text in the following format:
\begin{verbatim}
    User: <utterance>
    Gopher: <utterance>
    User: <utterance>
    Gopher: <utterance>
    ...
\end{verbatim}
To send a user's message to \gopher, we append the string \texttt{"User: \{message\}"} to the dialogue history. To elicit a response from \gopher, we append \texttt{"\textbackslash n\textbackslash nGopher: "} to the history and then sample conditioned on the entire history, using nucleus sampling with  \citep{holtzman2019curious}. We truncate the sample when either \gopher generates the string \texttt{"\textbackslash n\textbackslash nUser: "} (indicating it has finished its `turn') or we hit a maximum length.

In \autoref{fig:gopherchat-prompt} we include the complete prompt used to condition \gopher towards dialogue. With our SentencePiece tokenizer, this prompt consumes roughly 800 tokens of the 2048-token context \gopher was trained with. In practice this leaves plenty of room for subsequent dialogue.

\end{table}


\subsection{Dialogue Dataset Filtering}
\label{app:dialogue_data}
We construct a dataset of two-person dialogue by taking \massiveweb and applying a filtering heuristic based on a common written dialogue format (``interview transcript'' style). 

Concretely, we find all sets of consecutive paragraphs (blocks of text separated by two newlines) at least 6 paragraphs long, with all paragraphs having a prefix ending in a separator (e.g., \mbox{``Gopher: ''}, \mbox{``Dr Smith - ''}, or \mbox{``Q. ''}). The even-indexed paragraphs must have the same prefix as each other, and the same for the odd-indexed paragraphs, but both prefixes should be different (in other words, the conversation must be strictly back-and-forth between two individuals). This procedure reliably yields high-quality dialogue.


\subsection{Comparison Methodology}
\label{app:gopherchat_methodology}
We discuss the methodology used to compare \gopherchatsl, a supervised fine-tuned \gopher on a dialogue-subset of \massiveweb, and \gopherchat.

We instructed participants to express preference over the two models that would jointly engage in a central dialogue. At each turn, they are shown a \gopherchat move and a \gopherchatsl move, and the participant selects the one they prefer. Each dialogue continues according to either the prompted or tuned model, independent of the user's choice. We call this the \textit{move selector}.

When the \textit{move selector} is set to \textit{prompted} the response is always chosen to be the prompted model. In theory this gives the prompted model an advantage, as it is sitting closer to its own distribution of conversation. We compare the models under both \textit{move selector} settings and find there is no statistical difference in preference between the two, displayed in \autoref{tab:prompted_gopher_preference}.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\textbf{Move selector} & Prompted  & Fine-tuned \\

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{RTP in a Dialogue Setting}
\label{appendix:dialgoue_rtp}

To evaluate \gopherchat we obtain a set of questions based on the RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) dataset, where prompt and continuation contain `?'. 
We remove the continuation after the `?' and sample 500 questions from each of the toxicity buckets [0.0, 0.25), [0.25, 0.5), [0.5, 0.75), [0.75, 1.0], according to \perspectiveapi scores, resulting in 2000 questions in total. 
Next we feed an RTP question as the User's utterance to the \gopherchat models and sample 25 continuations per question (up to  tokens).  
We then evaluate the continuations of dialogue-prompted models with these questions and present the aggregate results in \autoref{fig:dialogue_rtp}.

\subsection{Selected Transcripts}
\label{appendix:gopherchat-transcripts}

The following transcripts exhibit some of the qualities and common failings of the model. Explanations and additional observations are contained in captions. All of these transcripts were collected via open-ended dialogue between \gopherchat and one of the authors. Some transcripts are truncated for brevity.

And it can be programmed to reason

And it can drive autonomous vehicles

It can give a tremendous insight

Into how our brain really works

It's an old field, from the dawn of the days

With deep roots and a history long

It's changed how we work and how we live

It's the future, and we're almost there

And it's changing lives, and helping us

It's a very exciting time

It's even working with the World Health Organization

To fight the coronavirus pandemic

In the future it will help us

It's good for so many reasons

With it we can fly like birds

And maybe travel to Mars

We can do so many things

But the most important one is

We can understand ourselves

And our place in the universe } \\
