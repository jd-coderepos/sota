\begin{abstract}



Modeling complex spatiotemporal dependencies in correlated traffic series is essential for traffic prediction. While recent works have shown improved prediction performance by using neural networks to extract spatiotemporal correlations, their effectiveness depends on the quality of the graph structures used to represent the spatial topology of the traffic network. In this work, we propose a novel approach for traffic prediction that embeds time-varying dynamic Bayesian network to capture the fine spatiotemporal topology of traffic data. We then use graph convolutional networks to generate traffic forecasts. To enable our method to efficiently model nonlinear traffic propagation patterns, we develop a deep learning-based module as a hyper-network to generate stepwise dynamic causal graphs. Our experimental results on a real traffic dataset demonstrate the superior prediction performance of the proposed method. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/MonBG/DCGCN}.

\section{INTRODUCTION}










Urban transportation plays a crucial role in modern life. With the rapid development of urbanization, the fast growing urban population and the number of cars bring great pressure to urban transportation system. In this situation, traffic prediction can help understand traffic propagation patterns and serves as the cornerstone of traffic management. 


In the last decades, thousands of data-driven methods for traffic prediction have been proposed. Classical statistical methods, e.g., vector auto-regression (VAR) \cite{zivot2006vector}, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) \cite{box2015time}, are pioneering works used to model traffic series. Later,
deep learning based methods \cite{tedjopurnomo2020survey} began to be increasingly popular, and achieved the overwhelming results. Most state-of-the-art deep learning methods integrate graph convolution network (GCN) \cite{kipf2016semi} into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) \cite{li2017diffusion,bai2020adaptive} or 1-D convolution neural networks (CNNs) on the time axis \cite{yu2017spatio,guo2019attention} to model spatiotemporal dependencies of traffic data. However, the effectiveness of GCN generally depends on the quality of the graph adjacency matrix, which is expected to fully capture the spatial characteristics of the real traffic network. Some popularly used graph adjacency matrices include traffic road topology \cite{huang2020lsgcn,ziyue2021tensor,li2022individualized,li2020tensor,mao2022jointly}, traffic data correlation \cite{yao2018deep, tsung2020discussion,li2022profile,li2020long,wang2023correlated}, etc. 

In recent years, casual discovery emerges and is being explored in many machine learning applications. Casual discovery aims to analyze causal relationships behind statistical correlations of different variables and facilitate better machine learning. \revise{Typical approaches to incorporate causal discovery include encoding features from domain-specific causal models as input to downstream tasks \cite{wang2022causalgnn} and learning the structure of causal relationships between features for graph-based models \cite{luan2022traffic, lan2023mm}.} As a powerful graph-based tool for modeling directed causal relationships between variables, Bayesian network (BN) is being applied in traffic prediction \cite{luan2022traffic}. By representing the traffic propagation trend with directed links, BN shows its potential for explicitly modeling traffic propagation pattern \cite{liu2011discovering}. Furthermore, BN could be extended to dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) \cite{murphy2002dynamic} to capture temporal dependencies in traffic series. 

A limitation of current casual-embedded traffic prediction models is the assumption of stationary temporal dependencies. However, in reality, the dependencies of traffic data in different places do change over time. Recent works \cite{li2021dynamic} based on GCN have proposed to generate a \revise{time-invariant} adaptive graph from trainable node embeddings during model training. However, to our best knowledge, there is no work to incorporate causal learning into adaptive spatial topology construction, which is expected to learn time-varying graphs with good explainability for traffic prediction. 


In this work, we propose a novel causal-embedded approach for traffic prediction. It represents the spatiotemporal traffic network topology using a time-varying DBN (TVDBN), which is designed to adapt to the time-varying traffic propagation patterns by learning DBNs step by step. The learned TVDBN is able to summarize the dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies between nodes. Built upon it, graph convolution is applied to capture spatial dependencies for traffic prediction. We propose a complete deep learning based causal structure learning module that serves as a pre-trained hyper-network to generate the graphs of the TVDBN. The predefined distance graph is further incorporated into graph generator and traffic prediction module as additional prior information to improve the performance. The contributions of our work are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose an approach based on GCN and RNN to learn a TVDBN that describes the time-varying causal relationships between different locations in traffic network. The augmented Lagrange method is applied for model training to ensure the acyclicity of the TVDBN. 
        \item To our knowledge, we are the first to learn the structure of TVDBN using deep learning. Compared with traditional causal structure learning methods by machine learning or statistics, our method can capture nonlinear causal relationships between nodes more flexibly. 
\item We uses the learned TVDBN as dynamic causal adjacency graphs in the downstream GCN-based traffic prediction module. Curriculum learning is used in training to achieve better performance. The training of TVDBN structure learning and traffic prediction modules are conducted separately and sequentially, which improves performance and reduces the training time. 
        \item We conduct experiments on a widely used traffic benchmark dataset METR-LA to evaluate the traffic prediction performance of the proposed model. The results show that our model can outperform the classical and state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction performance.
\end{itemize}



\section{RELATED WORK}


\subsection{Deep Learning Based Traffic Prediction}
The main challenge of traffic prediction is capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic data. This involves three tasks including spatial topology construction, spatial dependency modeling and temporal dependency modeling \cite{li2021dynamic}.


\textbf{Spatial topology construction} aims to summarize the structural information of the traffic network into well-defined graph data structures, which are then used to extract spatial dependencies.
CNN-based methods \cite{yao2018deep,lin2019deepstn+} were first proposed to divide maps into equally sized grids as images, and used convolution to describe correlations between neighbouring girds. Later to better process non-Euclidean correlations, graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a more flexible representation of the traffic network. For GNNs, it is crucial to construct a suitable adjacency matrix. The most common way is to predefine a proximity metric between pairs of nodes, such as geographic distance or connectivity \cite{li2017diffusion,yu2017spatio,zheng2020gman}. However, the predefined adjacency matrix is static and has limited ability to describe highly dynamic spatial correlations between traffic data. To address this, some methods set the adjacency matrix as learnable parameters \cite{zhang2020spatio} or generate it from learnable node embeddings \cite{bai2020adaptive, wu2020connecting}, consequently allowing the graph to adapt to the actual data. The Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DGCRN) \cite{li2021dynamic} goes further by generating a self-adaptive dynamic adjacency matrix at each time step. While this approach offers high representational flexibility, the resulting dynamic graphs lack interpretability in practical applications, limiting their generalization to other traffic analysis scenarios.

\textbf{Spatial dependency modeling} targets at mining correlations between spatial nodes from the constructed spatial topology. For grid-based spatial modeling, CNN-based methods \cite{yao2018deep,lin2019deepstn+} apply 2-D convolution to capture spatial dependencies in Euclidean data. For graphs represented spatial modeling, most state-of-the-art methods use GNNs to process spatial information by aggregating messages from neighboring nodes through graph convolution or attention mechanisms \cite{li2017diffusion,yu2017spatio,zheng2020gman}. Recent works propose more complicated graph convolution modules to enhance the expressive power and address the over-smoothing issue of GCN \cite{wu2020connecting}. 


\textbf{Temporal dependency modeling} is critical in time series analysis. Recurrent neural networks are widely used to capture temporal dependencies between parts of the sequence. 
GRU \cite{cho2014learning} and LSTM \cite{hochreiter1997long} are further proposed to improve the ability to model long-term dependencies by introducing a gate mechanism to control the ratio of retaining long-term information. In traffic prediction, to incorporate spatial information, an intuitive approach is to use the outputs of spatial modules as input to RNN \cite{zhao2019t}. Some works also modify the computation of gates to include graph convolution in GRU and LSTM \cite{li2017diffusion, bai2020adaptive}. To reduce the computational cost of RNN, CNN can be used in modeling temporal dependencies with 1-D convolution on the time axis \cite{yu2017spatio}. Recently, attention mechanisms are also applied for modeling long-term dependencies, e.g., ASTGCN \cite{guo2019attention} and GMAN \cite{zheng2020gman}. 


\subsection{Bayesian Network}


As an efficient method for modeling directed causal relationships between variables, Bayesian networks (BNs) have been applied in many applications \cite{hossain2019framework, tsagris2021new}. \revise{BN is a probabilistic graphical model that takes the form of a directed acyclic graphs (DAG).} In a BN, nodes represent variables, and directed edges represent casual dependencies between nodes. By learnisng the edges and parameters of the BN, the joint distribution of all the variables can be analyzed. To further capture causal relationships in time series, dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) \cite{murphy2002dynamic} extend this to multivariate time series data by accounting for causality between variables across and within time steps. By further assuming the causality structure changes over time, time-varying DBN (TVDBN) is further proposed \cite{robinson2008non}. In particular, different types of time-varying patterns include step-wise change, smooth change, etc. As to casual structure learning of BN and its variants, there are two types of methods in general: constraint-based and score-based methods \cite{vowels2022d}. Constraint-based methods \cite{runge2019detecting} rely on the validity of statistical assumptions and score-based methods \cite{zheng2018dags} require an appropriate structure score with an efficient combinatorial structure search strategy. By replacing the acyclicity constraint of BN with a continuous penalty, recent works \cite{zheng2018dags} transform score-based methods into the well-studied continuous optimization problem.

Traffic analysis can benefit from the use of Bayesian networks to reveal traffic propagation patterns, which is an alternative to representing spatial topology. Liu et al.\cite{liu2011discovering} proposed to learn a DBN with tree structure to uncover causal interactions between traffic events. DBGCN \cite{luan2022traffic} applys graph convolution to extract spatiotemporal dependencies from a DBN learned by statistics. However, most existing BN and DBN-based models in traffic analysis learn graphs through statistical methods, which are simple linear models with the assumption of a stationary traffic process. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, there is no work embedding TVDBN into traffic prediction to capture time-varying causal relationships of traffic data. 

\section{PRELIMINARIES}


\subsection{Problem Definition}

The task of traffic prediction aims to predict the future traffic variables, such as speed and flow, using historical data. The traffic network is denoted as , where  is a set of  nodes representing different locations (e.g., sensors or road segments) in the traffic network, and  is a set of edges representing the geographic connection between nodes.  is the weighted adjacency matrix corresponding to  where each element represents the connectivity or proximity between nodes.  is treated as the prior information about the network structure.

The multivariate traffic series are denoted as a feature tensor  of , where  is the length of the historical traffic series and  is the number of features of each node. Let  represents the traffic state observed at time  and  represents the features from time  to . The traffic prediction problem is to learn a function  to predict the next  step traffic conditions   based on the past  step historical data :

where  is the number of traffic variables to predict.

\subsection{Time-Varying Dynamic Bayesian Network}
We start with DBN that captures stationary spatiotemporal causal dependencies between time series. The value of the -th time series at time  is represented by . We assume that time series influence each other in both a contemporaneous and a time-lagged manner, which are called intra-slice and inter-slice dependencies, respectively. Such dependencies can be determined by a graph structure  and a set of parameterized functions . If the value of  affects the value of , the time series  belongs to the -lag parent set of the time series , denoted by . We model the dependencies using the following general structural equation model (SEM):

where  is the lag order and  represents the feature tensor of the -lag parent of the time series  at time . For the linear condition, the SEM follows the standard structural VAR model \cite{kilian2013structural}:

where  is the influence coefficient that captures the directional relationship of the time series  to the time series  with lag .  is a vector of centered error terms that are independent within and across time.  is the element of the -lag weighted adjacency matrices of , which allows us to write the equation \eqref{eq:svar_vec} in matrix form:

where  and  if . 
The directed graph represented by intra-slice matrix  is required to be acyclic in causal meaning.

        \label{fig:tvdbn}
\end{figure}

Traditional DBN assumes a stationary data generation process, i.e.,  remains the same for each , which is not always valid in reality. As in Fig. \ref{fig:tvdbn}, time-varying DBN allows the graph structure and parameters to change over time. The SEM of TVDBN is:

with  and the corresponding linear SEM is:

\subsection{Model Framework}
In this section, we introduce the architecture of the proposed \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{C}onvolutional \textbf{N}etwork (DCGCN). As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:framework}, DCGCN is composed of three blocks including feature extraction, GCN-based recurrent causal structure learning (GRCSL) and dynamic graph convolution prediction module (DGCPM). The feature extraction block incorporates time of day and prior graph structures to augment the traffic data. The resulting features are fed into GRCSL to generate graphs of TVDBN. GRCSL is trained as a hyper-network based on the causal reconstruction loss of the input sequence. DGCPM applies graph convolution to the dynamic causal graphs of TVDBN generated by the pre-trained GRCSL and produces the final traffic forecasts. The details of each block are explained in the following subsections.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}

To accurately model traffic conditions, it is crucial to consider the dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies of the traffic network, which are influenced by the topology of the network and exhibit diverse characteristics on short and long-term time horizons. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate geographic and temporal information into the input features to describe the dynamic traffic status.


At each discrete time step ,  is the value of traffic parameters (speed or flow) and  represents time of day. Given the weighted adjacency matrix  of geographical traffic network as prior information, we extract the spatial features by spectral-based graph convolution \cite{kipf2016semi}:

where  is a  layers spectral-based graph convolution operation with skip connection defined as
\vspace{-2pt}

with adjacency matrix , identity matrix  and learnable parameters  for . The final features are obtained by concatenation

\revise{where concatenation operator  represents joining two matrices or tensors along the last dimension.} 

\subsection{GCN-Based Recurrent Causal Structure Learning}




We propose to capture the time-varying causal structure in traffic series by RNN, which generates the dynamic causal graphs stepwise from its hidden state. The challenge is to construct suitable input features for RNN that contain information about the dynamics of the causal structure. To address this challenge, we use an attention mechanism with multi-head scaled dot-product \cite{vaswani2017attention}, to describe the spatiotemporal correlations between nodes, i.e.,

where  and  are learnable parameters of linear transformation,  is the number of heads and the learnable parameters of each head are different.  and  are indicators of intra-slice and -lag inter-slice spatial correlations, respectively. We further flatten the tensors  to matrices in , denoted by , such that each row of  captures the dynamics of an element in . Subsequently,  is treated as the input of GRU, i.e.,

where  and  are learnable parameters. \revise{ represents element-wise product between two matrices or tensors.}  is the hidden state with dimension . Then we unflatten the hidden states as tensors in  and generate causal graphs by three layers  convolution:

where ReLU is added after each layer except the last. Following MCSL, we apply Gumbel-Sigmoid to force the elements of  to be close to  or .
In addition, the diagonal elements of the intra-slice matrices are masked as zero to satisfy the acyclic constraint of .


Considering the complex nonlinear dynamics in real traffic data, we extend the linear SEM Eq. \eqref{eq:li_sem} to a nonlinear version by spatial-based graph convolution \cite{hamilton2017inductive}, i.e.,

where  is a  layers spatial-based graph convolution operation with skip connections defined as:

With the GCN-based SEM, we reconstruct the current state value with the generated graphs by

where MLP is the multilayer perceptron.


By minimizing the sum of squares between  and  and increasing the sparsity of  under the acyclicity constraint of intra-slice graphs, we learn the GCN-based recurrent casual structure learning (GRCSL) network. Note that when the input time series length is set to , GRCSL can only generate -lag DBNs of the last  time steps. To balance the number of time steps for generating causal graphs and the number of lag in causal learning, both of which impact the representation capability in the DGCPM, we choose  in this paper.



\subsection{Dynamic Graph Convolution Prediction Module}
Built upon GRCSL, we propose a dynamic graph convolution prediction module (DGCPM) to predict multi-step traffic status. In DGCPM, we redefine  and incorporate time-varying causal structure  together with the static graph . 


Note that SEM is designed to reconstruct the current state of a variable from the current and historical states of its parent variables. However, since the future state of the variable is unknown, intra-slice dependencies are not available in prediction. To address this problem, we decompose the general SEM in prediction into a two-step process:

where  and  are the initial and final predictions of , respectively.  takes historical data as input to capture inter-slice dependencies and  takes the initial prediction of  as input to capture intra-slice dependencies. Given , for GCN-based SEM at the future time , we have:

where  is treated as an approximation to . To highlight the importance of the current state of a node in predicting its future state, we add an identity matrix to the adjacency matrices before graph convolution. We define the above two-step graph convolution process on TVDBN as dynamic graph convolution .

Given the dynamic causal graphs  generated from GRCSL, we fuse the output features of dynamic graph convolution at all time steps with node embeddings generated from spectral-based prior graph convolution, i.e.,

Then we obtain the traffic prediction by applying a linear transformation to the above features:

where  is the learnable parameter of linear transformation.

\subsection{Model Training}
To reduce the computation complexity, we train GRCSL and DGCPM sequentially. In particular, GRCSL combined with the feature extraction block, is treated as a hyper-network and trained by optimizing the following problem:

where  represents all the learnable parameters of GRCSL, , ,  is the NOTEARS constraint to ensure the acyclicity of intra-slice graphs, and  means the trace of a matrix. Note that we ignore the offset in time index here to improve readability. We use the augmented Lagrangian approach to solve problem Eq. \eqref{eq:grcsl} with the following augmented Lagrangian function\cite{yu2019dag}:

where  is the step size parameter and  is the Lagrange multiplier. When  goes to positive infinity, the minimizer of  must satisfy the NOTEARS constraint. We update ,  and  with the following strategy:

where  is the iteration index,  and  are hyperparameters. We stop iterations when  is less than a small number . The subproblem Eq. \eqref{eq:lagr_sub} is to learn GRCSL with  as the loss function, which can be solved by stochastic gradient descent.

Built upon the pre-trained GRCSL, we train the DGCPM by using the mean absolute error loss as the objective function and minimizing the multi-step prediction loss with curriculum learning. We start by training the model to make one-step predictions and gradually increase the prediction length to its maximum  as the training iterations progress. This approach helps the algorithm to find a good local minimum for the model in the early stages, which is advantageous for achieving better prediction performance in the end.

\subsection{Experimental Settings}
We conduct experiments on a public real-world traffic dataset \textbf{METR-LA}, which contains traffic speed data collected from loop detectors in the highway of Los Angeles \cite{jagadish2014big}. METR-LA collects 4 months of data ranging from Mar 1st 2012 to Jun 30th 2012 from 207 selected sensors. In our experiments, the sensors in different locations are viewed as nodes in the traffic network.

Following DCRNN \cite{li2017diffusion}, we set the time granularity of speed data to 5 minutes and apply Z-Score normalization. 70\% of data is used for training, 20\% are used for testing while the remaining 10\% for validation. The predefined weighted adjacency matrix  is constructed by calculating the pairwise road network distances between sensors:

where  is the road network distance from sensor  to sensor .  is the standard deviation of distances and  is the threshold parameter. The input and output sequence length  and  are set to . The prediction target is traffic speed with dimension . Number of layers in graph convolution  is . For missing values marked as zero in METR-LA, we filter out the missing values in loss function and metrics calculation.

\revise{Following previous work\cite{yu2019dag}, we empirically set the hyperparameters ,  and . The  penalty weight  is chosen as  to slightly control false discoveries. A detailed selection of the hyperparameters could also be achieved by a grid search, but this involves high computational costs. The initial value of the Lagrange multiplier is set to , i.e. . And  is set to  so that the optimization program focuses on minimizing the reconstruction error at an early stage.}

\subsection{Baselines and Evaluation Metrics}
We compare our proposed method with the classical and state-of-the-art deep learning based models, including (1) \textbf{VAR} \cite{zivot2006vector}: a statistical model which captures linear correlations between future traffic series and historical data; (2) \textbf{DCRNN} \cite{li2017diffusion}: an RNN-based model which integrates diffusian graph convolutions into RNN with encoder-decoder structure; (3) \textbf{STGCN} \cite{yu2017spatio}: a complete convolutional model which capture spatial and temporal dependencies by graph convolution and 1D-convolution on time axis, respectively; (4) \textbf{ASTGCN} \cite{guo2019attention}: adding an attention mechanisms into STGCN by using spatial and temporal attention to adjust the input before convolution. (5) \textbf{AGCRN} \cite{bai2020adaptive}: an RNN-based model which learns an adaptive static graph and integrates graph convolution with node adaptive parameter learning into GRU gate; 
(6) \textbf{DBGCN} \cite{luan2022traffic}: an GCN-based model that learns an adptive stationary DBN through statistical methods and applies graph convolution sequentially to graphs of the DBN. This is the only work also considering causality for spatial dependence analysis.

For all the baselines, we use the default settings from their original papers. The performance of traffic prediction is measured by three commonly used metrics, including (1) Mean Absolute Error (\textbf{MAE}), (2) Root Squared Error (\textbf{RMSE}), and (3) Mean Absolute Percentage Error (\textbf{MAPE}).

\caption{Prediction performance of ablation study at each horizon.}
        \label{fig:ablation}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Performance Comparison}

We compare the prediction performances for the future step 3 (15 minutes), step 6 (30 minutes), and step 12 (1 hour). The comparison between all methods is shown in Table \ref{tab:baselines}. Note that since the computational cost of learning DBN for DBGCN on a large dataset is intolerable, we compare the proposed method with DBGCN on a subset of METR-LA with 20 nodes. The results show that: (1) methods with adaptive spatial dependence graphs, such as AGCRN, generally achieve better performance than other methods based on a static predefined graph, indicating the importance of adaptive spatial topologies. (2) Our methods outperform other adaptive dynamic graphs based methods in both short-term and long-term traffic prediction. This illustrates the advantages of using causality-based spatial dependence analysis in prediction compared with correlation-based analysis. (3) The two points above can also be validated by comparing our DCGCN with DBGCN, which uses static causal graph for spatial dependence. It demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed DCGCN. 

\subsection{Ablation Study}





To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the key modules of our DCGCN, we conduct an ablation study at METR-LA. Considering the computational burden of certain models, we perform the ablation experiments on a subset of METR-LA with 20 nodes. We name DCGCN without certain modules as follows: (1) \textbf{dist}: DCGCN without GRCSL. We replace the dynamic causal graphs generated by GRCSL with a static predefined distance graph. (2) \textbf{static DBN}: DCGCN without GRCSL. We replace the dynamic causal graphs from GRCSL with a static DBN learned using classical casuality discovery methods \cite{trabelsi2013dynamic}.
(3) \textbf{w/o prior}: DCGCN without incorporating prior information (i.e., the predefined distance graph) in feature extraction module and DGCPM.

We report the results in Fig. \ref{fig:ablation}, and can draw some conclusions as follows: (1) Compared with the predefined distance graph, DGCPM based on causal graphs including static DBN and TVDBN shows better prediction performance. It validates that causal discovery is helpful for constructing finer spatial-temporal topology representation of the traffic network. (2) DCGCN outperforms models based on static DBN, demonstrating the need to capture nonlinear and time-varying causal traffic propagation patterns. (3) Incorporating prior information such as distance-based spatial topology of the traffic network helps to construct better dynamic causal graphs, leading to better prediction performance.


\section{CONCLUSIONS}
In this work, we propose a novel approach to enhance the performance of GCN-based methods for traffic prediction by incorporating time-varying dynamic causal graphs that can capture time-varying spatiotemporal relationships of traffic series. By leveraging deep learning to model the generation mechanism of causal graphs, we can significantly reduce the computational cost of structure learning for TVDBN. Our experimental results on the METR-LA dataset show that our proposed method achieves superior prediction performance in both the short-term and long-term scales. Overall, our approach offers a promising solution for accurately modeling time-varying spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic prediction with the help of causal discovery. Further investigation into the dynamic causal graphs learned from GRCSL can be beneficial in uncovering the time-varying traffic propagation patterns in the future. Such insights can help us better understand the underlying spatial dependence relationships of traffic systems.
