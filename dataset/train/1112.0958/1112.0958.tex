\begin{abstract}
Chaos and its applications in the field of secure communications have attracted a lot of attention.
Chaos-based pseudo-random number generators are critical to guarantee security over open networks as the Internet.
We have previously demonstrated that it is possible to define such generators with good statistical properties by using a tool called ``chaotic iterations'', which depends on an iteration function.
An approach to find update functions such that the associated generator presents a random-like and chaotic behavior is proposed in this research work.
To do so, we use the vectorial Boolean negation as a prototype and explain how to modify this iteration function without deflating the good properties of the associated generator.
Simulation results and basic security analysis are then presented to evaluate the randomness of this new family of generators.

\section{Introduction}

Security has become a topic of increasing importance in communications because the Internet and personal communications systems are now accessible worldwide.
To guarantee this security, chaotic systems have many advantages as unpredictability or disorder-like, and they are especially used when complex sequences are required~\cite{Behnia20113455,Hu20092286,DeMicco20083373}.
This is why chaotic systems are frequently used to design new pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) ~\cite{Behnia20113455,Niansheng}.Following this approach, we have previously proposed a PRNG based on chaotic iterations. A short overview of our recent researches in this field is given hereafter.

In Ref.~\cite{guyeux09}, it is proven  that chaotic  iterations (CIs),  a suitable
tool for fast computing  iterative algorithms, satisfies the topological chaos
property, as defined by Devaney~\cite{devaney}.  The chaotic behavior of CIs
is used in~\cite{bgw09:ip}, to obtain an unpredictable PRNG that
depends on two  logistic maps.   The resulted  PRNG shows
better   statistical   properties   than   each  individual   component   alone.
Additionally, various chaos properties  have been established. These chaos properties, inherited from CIs, are not
possessed by  the two inputted generators.   We have shown that,  in addition of
being  chaotic,  this generator  can  pass the  NIST  battery  of tests,  widely
considered as a  comprehensive and stringent battery of  tests for cryptographic
applications~\cite{nist}.
Then we have achieved  to improve the speed of the former generator in~\cite{bgw10:ip,guyeuxTaiwan10}, by using ISAAC and XORshift instead of the two logistic maps.
These generators can pass the batteries DieHARD~\cite{diehard} and TestU01~\cite{testU01}.

In these previous researches, the iteration function of CIs was always the vectorial Boolean negation.
We propose now to enlarge the set of iteration functions such that the associated CI-based generator is both chaotic and random-like.
The well-known NIST and DieHARD tests are finally used to evaluate the statistical behavior of this new family of generators.



The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next
section, some basic definitions concerning CIs and our PRNG are recalled.
In Section~\ref{section:description} is explained how it is possible to change the iteration function of the generator without losing the good properties of our PRNG.
NIST and DieHARD batteries are passed in Section~\ref{sec:nist} to all of these generators.
 The
paper ends with a conclusion section where our contribution is summarized and intended future work is presented.







\section{Review of Basics}
\label{Basic recalls}

This section is devoted to basic notations and terminologies in the fields of chaotic iterations and PRNGs.

\subsection{Chaotic iterations}
\label{subsection:Chaotic iterations}

\begin{definition}
Let  be an ``iteration'' function and . Then, the so-called \emph{chaotic iterations} are defined by~\cite{Robert1986}  and

\end{definition}
In other words, at the  iteration, only the th cell is
\textquotedblleft iterated\textquotedblright.



\subsection{Mapping matrix}

Chaotic iterations introduced above can be described by using the mapping matrix defined bellow.

\begin{definition}
Let 
be an iteration function, then its associated \emph{mapping matrix}
 is the matrix of size  whose element   is the integer having the following binary decomposition:  , where  (resp. ) is the th binary digit of  (resp. of ).
\end{definition}

The relation between  and chaotic iterations of  can be
understood as follows. If the current state of the system is  and the
strategy is , then the next state (under the chaotic iterations of ) will be . Finally, the vector  is called \emph{vector of images}.
An example is shown for the vectorial Boolean negation  in Table~

This  generator may utilize any reasonable PRNGs as inputs.
For demonstration purposes, two XORshift are adopted here for both
PRNG1 and PRNG2.
Table \ref{table application example} gives an illustrative example using these PRNGs,

\section{Description of the selection scheme}
\label{section:description}

In this section is explained how the iteration function  can be replaced without losing chaos and randomness.

\subsection{Strong connectivity and chaos}


Let . Its
{\emph{iteration graph}}  is the directed graph defined as follows. 
The set of vertices is
, and ,
 contains an arc labeled  from  to . 
We have proven in~\cite{GuyeuxThese10} that:


\begin{theorem}
\label{Th:Caractérisation   des   IC   chaotiques}
The  generator is chaotic according to Devaney if and only if the graph  is strongly connected.
\end{theorem}

Theorem \ref{Th:Caractérisation   des   IC   chaotiques} only focus on the topological chaos property.
However, it is possible to find chaotic sequences with bad statistical properties, in particular when the iteration function is unbalanced.


\subsection{Obtaining Balanced Maps}
\label{The generation of pseudo-random sequence}



We now explain how to find balanced iterate functions.

\begin{theorem}
Let  and  be the (balanced) vectorial Boolean negation: .

If , a vector of images of a \emph{balanced} iterate function , is such that its th component differs from  by only its  bit (starting from the right), then .
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
As  only differs from  by its  bit, we have: 
Therefore, the value  of the mapping matrix of  can be computed as follows:

The values in  are uniformly distributed.
However, in the new matrix , there are twice the value  and no  in the -th row: the uniform distribution is lost. 
To restore the balance, one of the two  values must be found and replaced by . Let  be a variable such that  and .


As the th bits in  and  are equal, we have:


We can thus transform the equation  as follows:


Moreover, from , we obtain:


According to Equations (\ref{eq6}) and (\ref{eq7}), we have:


As

and according to Equation (\ref{eq8}), we thus have:
 

Now, from Equation (\ref{eq5}), we can set that:


By using both Equations (\ref{eq9}) and (\ref{eq10}), we obtain:



Finally, from Equation (\ref{eq8}), we can conclude that:

\end{proof}

With such equations (namely, Eq. (\ref{eq11}) and (\ref{eq12})), the balance of the new table can be obtained by computing the mapping values. In other words, there is a bijection from the set A of the inputs  into the set B of  values.

Let us give an example. In Table~\ref{negation_output} is given the mapping matrix for the vectorial Boolean negation, with . Obviously, the values in  are uniformly distributed: each integer from 0 to 15 occurs once per row. 
Now, if we desire to set  as 14, then : there will be two  and no  in the fourth row of . Due to the previous study, we know that  must be set to 15 too, which leads to : the balance is recovered.

To sum up, we can determine whether the modification of a bit in the vector of images of the negation function preserves the balance of the outputs or not, by using the following rule (necessary condition):
\begin{itemize}
\item if ,
\item then ,
\item and also .
\end{itemize}

This rule, we name it ``Balance Iteration Mapping Rule'', can be used as a criterion to find iterate functions leading to good CI PRNGS, as it is depicted in Algorithm \ref{Chaotic iteration}.
Let us finally remark that, with such a process, it is possible to find new iteration functions by changing more than 1 couple of values in the vectorial Boolean negation . Indeed it is obvious that 2, 3, 4, and even 8 couples of values can be changed using the Balance Iteration Mapping Rule.
For instance, Table~\ref{New vectors of images} contains 8 vectors of images obtained by using Algorithm \ref{Chaotic iteration} one or more times. All of these functions satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem \ref{Th:Caractérisation   des   IC   chaotiques} too, and thus their dynamical systems behave chaotically.

\section{Statistical analysis}
\label{sec:nist}
A good random number generator must be indistinguishable from a random sequence through any statistical test. 
As an illustration of the theory presented in this paper, we have used various batteries of tests in order to evaluate the quality of our proposed pseudo random number generator, when iterating functions of Table~\ref{New vectors of images}. These batteries are the well-known and stringent  DIEHARD~\cite{diehard} and NIST~\cite{nist} statistical test suites.

We can conclude from Table \ref{The passing rate} that all of the generators based on the new iterate functions have successfully passed both the NIST and DieHARD batteries of tests. 
These results show the good statistical properties of the proposed PRNGs, and thus the interest of the theoretical approach presented in this paper.

\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{Conclusions and Future Work}

In previous researches, we have presented a pseudo-random number generator based on chaotic iterations.
It depends on an iteration function, formerly fixed to the negation function.
We have previously established a characterization of functions leading to a chaotic behavior for the associated generator.
However, this characterization allows unbalanced functions, whose generator cannot pass statistical tests.
We have proposed in this paper an algorithm that can find iteration functions leading to a chaotic generator statistically irreproachable. 
This algorithm has been used to find 8 functions such that their generators are both chaotic and able to pass the NIST and DIEHARD statistical batteries of tests.

In future work, we will continue to explore conditions that improve the randomness of the associated CI PRNGs. New statistical tests will be used to compare these PRNGs to existing ones, and a cryptanalysis of our generator will be proposed. 
Finally, new applications in computer science will be proposed, especially in the Internet security field.
