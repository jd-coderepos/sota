{\bf Abstract:}
In this paper we study problems of drawing graphs in the plane using 
edge length constraints and angle optimization. Specifically we consider the problem of  
maximizing the minimum angle, the {\em MMA problem}. 
We solve the {\em MMA} problem using a spring-embedding approach where two forces are applied to the vertices of the graph: a force optimizing edge lengths and a force optimizing angles. We solve analytically the problem of computing an optimal displacement of a graph vertex optimizing the angles between edges incident to it if the degree of the vertex is at most three. We also apply a numerical approach for  computing the forces applied to vertices of higher degree. We implemented our algorithm in Java and present drawings of some graphs.



\section{Introduction}

Angular resolution is one of the aesthetic criteria measuring the quality of graph drawings in terms of human comprehension. 
The {\em angular resolution} of a straight-line drawing in the plane is the minimum angle between any two incident edges.    
The study of graph drawing with angular resolution started by Formann \etal \cite{formann93} 
in 1990. They introduced the {\em angular resolution} of a graph as the supremum angular resolution over all straight-line drawings of the graph. The problem of computing the angular resolution of a graph is NP-hard (even the problem of deciding if  for graphs with vertex degrees at most four is NP-hard).   

The main focus in the early investigation \cite{formann93,mp-arpg-94} was on bounding the angular resolution of a graph in terms of the maximum vertex degree . The obvious upper bound is . A lower bound  has been proved \cite{formann93}  for many graphs including planar graphs and complete graphs. 
A lower bound  holds for all graphs \cite{formann93}.
If we insist on planar straight-line drawings, then   for some constant  \cite{mp-arpg-94}. 

There was also a study of the optimization problem where the angular resolution of a given graph is maximized.
Matousek \etal \cite{msw-96} considered an {\em angle-optimal placement of point in polygon}. In this problem,  the task is to find a point  in the kernel of a star-shaped polygon  such that after connecting  to all the vertices of  by straight edges, the minimum angle 
between two adjacent edges is maximized. The {\em kernel} of   is defined as the locus of 
all points inside  that see all the edges and vertices of  (it is not empty since  is star-shaped). They showed that it is an LP-type problem of combinatorial dimension 3.
Amenta \etal \cite{abe-99} studied various problems of optimal point placement for mesh smoothing (using different mesh quality measures). A related result is the polynomial-time 
algorithm for computing a Steiner point in a star-shaped polygon, minimizing 
the maximum angle. A parallel algorithm for mesh smoothing is presented in 
\cite{mesh1}.


Carlson and Eppstein \cite{ce-tcf-06} considered tree drawings such that  all faces form  convex polygons (the infinite faces are created by extending the edges incident on leaves to the infinity). They showed that the optimal angular resolution can be computed in linear time and even the lengths of the tree edges may be chosen arbitrarily.
In the recent paper, Eppstein and Wortman \cite{ew-oar-11} considered 
graph drawing in the plane with faces drawn as centrally symmetric convex polygons. 
They found a polynomial time algorithm for computing a drawing maximizing the angular resolution. 

Another direction in graph drawing with the angle resolution is {\em  Lombardi drawing} where 
the graph edges are represented as circular arcs instead of straight-line segments 
\cite{ccgkt-11,degkn-10,degkn-12}.
Relaxing  the condition of straight-line segments allows to achieve {\em perfect angular resolution} where the edges are equiangularly spaced around each vertex. 
The classes of graphs admitting Lombardi drawings are presented in \cite{degkn-12} (and the algorithms for finding these drawings). 
Duncan \etal~\cite{degkn-10} found  that unrooted trees can drawn with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area.

In this paper we study the problem of maximizing the angular resolution using the force-directed approach.  This idea is not new and some algorithms for optimizing angular resolution using the force-directed or spring-embedding approach \cite{abs-mtrg-10,ccgkt-11}. The common feature of these approaches is that the forces  are directed from one vertex to another vertex. 
Our approach is different in the sense that we want to optimize the dislocation of a vertex. 
It can be viewed as a restricted version of the angle-optimal placement of point in polygon
where a graph is embedded in the plane with straight-line edges and we want to find a new position of a given vertex by moving it at distance at most  (for a given ) and optimizing the incident angles. We call it {\em Max-Min Angle Problem} (MMA). 
This perturbation  problem is interesting in its own right. 
From combinatorial point of view, it is an LP-type problem with the same combinatorial 
dimension as the angle-optimal placement of point in polygon \cite{msw-96} since only one 
new constraint is added. However, the situation is quite different from the 
algebraic point of view.

The angle-optimal placement of point in polygon is related to the famous Fermat problem (which appears as a special case when the vertex degree is three). In general it is known as 
the Fermat-Weber problem: given  points in a Euclidean space , find a point minimizing the sum of the distances to  given points. This point is called the {\em geometric median}. We assume . 
If  then the geometric median can be computed exactly. However, it cannot be computed {\em exactly} if , in general (i.e. for some instances) \cite{b-ad-88}.  

The MMA problem is harder algebraically than the angle-optimal placement of point in polygon since the optimal point can be at distance  from the initial point. 
In fact, we show that even for a vertex of degree three,  the solution involves polynomials of degree 6 in some (difficult) cases. The polynomials of degree at least five  cannot be solved exactly in general. The main result of this paper is that  the solution of the MMA problem for a vertex of degree three can be computed {\em exactly} (we show that it can be expressed using a polynomial of degree four only).

Another reason why we introduce and study the MMA problem is that the parameter  allows to control the strength of the angular resolution force applied to vertices. This works well if we use more than one force. For example, we applied it to the spring embedding with length constraints. 

The paper is organized as follows.
In Section \ref{s2} we briefly describe force-directed graph drawing and introduce Max-Min-Angle problem. In Section \ref{s3} we recall the classical Fermat problem that appears as the special case of the MAA problem. In Section \ref{s:MAA} we provide a solution of the MMA problem for vertex degree two. 
Optimal solution for degree three vertices is provided in Section \ref{sectdeg3}. 
The algorithm and its performance is discussed in Section \ref{algorithm}.
Finally we conclude in Section \ref{concl}.


\section{Spring Embedder and Problem Statement} \label{s2}

Force-directed graph drawing is a popular technique and there is a growing literature on 
force-directed drawing algorithms, see the recent survey by Kobourov \cite{k-fdda-12}.
Eades \cite{EA84} introduced a mechanical model for graph drawing. 
To achieve aesthetically pleasing layouts and capture the edge length constraints he applied 
attracting/repelling force between two vertices if the distance between them is less/greater than the desired length. He found that the Hookes Law (linear) springs 
are too strong when the vertices are far apart but the logarithmic force solves this problem.
As initial embedding of the graph the algorithm places its vertices at random locations. 
The algorithm stops after a sufficient number of iterations. 
If a state of equilibrium is reached i.e. all forces are zero, then the graph embedding reaches 
the desired positioning in the plane and remains static. An example of such drawing is shown in Figure \ref{fig:algae}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{WeightesAlgaeDrawing.jpg}
\caption{A drawing of Algae graph \cite{pb-opn-12} produced by the spring embedder \cite{embedder}.}
\label{fig:algae}
\end{figure}

Fruchterman and Reingold \cite{ft91} added a condition of "even vertex distribution" which is modeled  by attractive forces between adjacent vertices and repulsive forces between all pairs of vertices. This increases the number of forces ( repulsive forces for a graph ) and slows down the algorithm.

The algorithms by Eades  \cite{EA84} and Fruchterman and Reingold \cite{ft91} are just two examples of force-directed graph drawing. There are many spring embedders nowadays \cite{k-fdda-12}. 
We consider a new force-directed approach for angular resolution where the vertex displacement is optimized locally. 

\subsection{Problem Statement}

We consider one step of the spring embedder where the vertices of a
graph  are embedded in the plane and they are allowed to move
slightly. The spring embedder may take into account several forces,
for example the forces aiming to achieve the desired lengths of the edges
of . We introduce a force that aims to optimize, for all vertices
, the angles between edges incident to  and embedded in the
plane. Ideally, we want the edges to spread evenly around . This
may not be possible due to other constraints of the drawing (edge
lengths, for example). Our goal is to maximize, for every ,  the
{\em smallest angle} between two edges incident to . 
For this, we formulate our problem.

\begin{quote}
{\bf Max-Min-Angle (MMA) Problem}.
Let  be a graph embedded in the plane. Let  be the position
of a vertex  of  and let  be the positions of the adjacent
vertices of  in . Let  be a radius. Find a point  (the
best position to move  within distance ) such that 
and the smallest angle  is maximized.
\end{quote}

Let  be the circle centered at  and radius . 
We will solve the MMA problem in Sections \ref{s:MAA} and \ref{sectdeg3}
by considering degree  of vertex .

\section{Fermat problem} \label{s3}

When the degree of  is three, the MMA  problem is related to 
the classical {\em Fermat problem}: Given triangle  in the plane, find a point  such that the total distance from the three vertices of the triangle to  is the minimum possible. 
The solution of the Fermat problem (called {\em Fermat point} or {\em Torricelli point}) depends on triangle .

\begin{figure}[htp] 
\centering
\includegraphics{pf1.pdf}
\caption{The Fermat point  in (a) Case 1 and (b) Case 2.
(a) Three angles , and  are equal.
(b) The Fermat point is at .}
\label{pf1}
\end{figure}

 {\bf Case 1:}  All angles of triangle  are smaller than .\\
Construct three new regular triangles  and  out of the three sides of triangle .
Then the point  is the intersection of three lines , and , see Figure \ref{pf1}(a). 
In this case the Fermat point   is coincident with the {\em first isogonic center} 
of the triangle \cite{Eric}, where the angles subtended by the sides of the triangle are all equal, 
i.e.  .

{\bf Case 2:}  There exists an angle  in triangle  greater than or equal to .\\
Only one angle of the triangle is greater than or equal to , say , see Figure \ref{pf1}(b) for example.
Then the Fermat point is coincident with .





\section{The MMA problem} \label{s:MAA}

We solve the MMA problem depending on the degree of vertex . 

\subsection{Vertex of Degree 2} \label{sectdeg2}

Suppose that the degree of  is two.  
Let  and  be the positions of its adjacent vertices. 
The task is to find a point  with  maximizing angle  (the angles are in the counterclockwise order).
Suppose that segment  intersects circle  .
Obviously,  is achieved by any point  in the intersection of  and .
The solution is unique if  is a single point (for example,  may be tangent to ). 


\begin{figure}[htp] 
\centering
\includegraphics{f2.pdf}
\caption{ The case where . (a)  where  is defined by Equation(\ref{deg2a}). (b) Point  lies not in .}
\label{f2}
\end{figure}

Suppose that  is a segment of positive length, see Figure \ref{f2}(a).
There are infinitely many positions of  (all in  achieving ).
If  is not on segment  then any location of  will change distances to  and .
We would like to preserve the ratio  and compute point  in segment  
such that . This implies



Then the coordinates of point  can be computed using



If point  lies in circle  then  as shown in Figure \ref{f2}(a).
Otherwise we select the endpoint of segment  that is closer to , see Figure \ref{f2}(b) for an example.

 

We assume now that  and  do not intersect.

\begin{prop} \label{propdeg2}
If segment  and circle  do not intersect then  is on the boundary of .
Furthermore the circle passing through , and  is tangent to .
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Suppose  where  and  are unknown.
Consider circular arc  as shown in Figure \ref{f1}(a).
The angles  are equal for all points  from arc  (since the inscribed angle of a chord equals half of the central angle ,see Figure \ref{pointInCirc}(b)). Therefore we can assume that  is on the boundary of . Furthermore arc   cannot intersect the boundary of  twice since any point  from the arc of  cut off by arc  makes an angle larger than  makes, i.e.
 as shown in Figure \ref{f1}. Thus, arc  must be tangent to  as shown in Figure \ref{f3}(a).
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}[htp] 
\centering
\includegraphics{f1.pdf}
\caption{Arc . Wrong location of  since .}
\label{f1}
\end{figure}








The MMA problem can be formulated now as the following problem dealing with only one angle.

\begin{quote}
{\bf Maximum Angle Problem}.
Let , and  be points in the plane and a number  such that .
Compute a point  with  maximizing angle
.
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics{f3.pdf}
\caption{(a) The maximum angle problem. (b) The circles centered at  and  are the two solutions of the system of equations (\ref{map1}) and (\ref{map2}). }
\label{f3}
\end{figure}

Let  be the center of the circle passing through , and .
It suffices to find point  since point  is the intersection point of the circle  and the line passing through points  and . The first equation is  and the second equation is linear

where the subscripts denote the coordinates.

Using coordinate transformations we can assume without loss of generality that  and , see Figure \ref{f3}(b). Then  implies that  where  is unknown. Let  be the radius of the circle centered at .  
Then  and . They can be written as



Subtracting Equation (\ref{map1}) from Equation (\ref{map2}) , we obtain


By plugging  from this equation into Equation of (\ref{map2})  we obtain a quadratic equation in the variable . There are two roots of the quadratic equation and they correspond to two circles shown in Figure \ref{f4}. Therefore we take the smallest root of the quadratic equation.


\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics{f4.pdf}
\caption{An example of the maximum angle problem. The circles centered at  and  are the two solutions of the system of equations (\ref{map1}) and (\ref{map2}). }
\label{f4}
\end{figure}

Therefore we proved the folowing claim.
\begin{prop} \label{propdeg2a}
The maximum angle problem can be solved using a quadratic equation.
\end{prop}



\section{Vertex of degree 3}  \label{sectdeg3}

In this Section we consider the case where the degree of  is three. 
Let  and  be the positions of its adjacent vertices in .
We consider the first case of the Fermat point of triangle  where all angles of  are less than .

\begin{prop} \label{prop2}
If all angles of  are less than  and 
the Fermat point  of  lies within circle , then .
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Without loss of generality we assume that 
 are in counterclockwise order around , see Figure \ref{Fpoint} (a).
Suppose to the contrary that  is a point inside  different from  as shown in Figure \ref{Fpoint} (b).
The Fermat point lies in one of triangles ,  or .
Suppose that it belongs to triangle . 
Then  and  is not the optimal point. 
Therefore , see Figure \ref{Fpoint} (c).
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}[htp] 
\centering
\includegraphics{lemma1c1.pdf}
\caption{(a) Setting of Proposition \ref{prop2}. (b) Contradiction when .  (c)  Points   and  coincide.}
\label{Fpoint}
\end{figure}

Note that in the case of Proposition \ref{prop2} all angles around  are equal 
.  
In the rest of this section we consider cases where not all angles 
,  and  are equal. 
If the smallest angle of ,  and 
is unique, say it is , then it can be computed by solving the maximum angle problem for  using the method from the previous section.
It remains to consider the case of two smallest angles.

\subsection{Two smallest angles} \label{twomin}

In this section we assume that there are exactly two smallest angles from . First, we show that  must be on the boundary of circle . 

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma2angles}
If the degree of  is 3 and there are two smallest angles around  then  lies on the boundary of . 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We assume that \\
(i)  are in counterclockwise order around , and \\
(ii) .\\
Suppose to the contrary that  lies inside  as shown in Figure \ref{pointInCirc}.
Draw two circles, one passing through points  and the second passing through points . Since these circles intersect by two points  and , then their interiors intersect by a lune. 
Since  is inside circle , then the intersection of the lune and the interior of  is  a non-empty set , see the shaded area in Figure \ref{pointInCirc}(a).
For any point  in ,  and  
(this can be seen, for example, by the fact that the inscribed angle of a chord equals half of the central angle, see Figure \ref{pointInCirc}(b)).
We choose  from  close enough to  such that . Then the smallest angle around  is greater than . 
Therefore  is not the solution of the MMA problem. Contradiction.
\end{proof}
 
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics{pointInCirc.pdf}
\caption{(a) For all points  in the shaded area  and .  (b)  The inscribed angle  of chord  equals half of the central angle .}
\label{pointInCirc}
\end{figure}

The main result in this section is the following

\begin{thm} \label{thm2angles}
If the degree of vertex  is three and there are two smallest angles around  then  can be computed by solving a polynomial equations of degree at most four.
\end{thm}


\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{Ipe2Angle.pdf}
\caption{
Points  and  are the points on circle  maximizing angles  and , respectively. Point  is different from  and  and angles .}
\label{Ipe2Angle}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
First we show that it is possible that there are two smallest angles. 
An example where two smallest angles around  are equal is shown in Figure  \ref{Ipe2Angle} where points  and  are collinear and 
points  and  are symmetric about the line .
Therefore angles  and  is the solution of the MMA problem.

We now prove the theorem. Suppose that . 
We need to find coordinates of .
By the law of cosines we write the equation  as



Without loss of generality we can assume that  and . 
By Lemma \ref{lemma2angles} we assume . 
Then  and

where ,\\
, 
,\\ .

Take the square of both sides of Equation (\ref{eq43})

It can be written as

where , \\
,\\
, \\
,\\
.

Using  we reduce powers of  in Equation (\ref{eq-c})

where
.



Simplifying Equation (\ref{eq11}) we get a sextic equation


where
,\\
,\\ 
.

By Lemma \ref{factor} the sextic equation has a quadratic factor. 
Dividing by it, we obtain a polynomial of degree four (Equation (\ref{eqn1}),(\ref{eqn2}), or
(\ref{eqn3})) and the theorem follows.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma} \label{factor}
The polynomial equation (\ref{eq12}) has factor .
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We consider 3 cases.

Case I: .
Then  and the polynomial (\ref{eq12}) 
has factor . The polynomial is reduced to the polynomial of degree 4


Case II: .
We scale the coordinates such that .
Then  ,  and the polynomial (\ref{eq12}) 
has factor . The polynomial is reduced to the polynomial of degree 4



Case III: .
We scale the coordinates such that .
Then  ,  and the polynomial (\ref{eq12}) 
has factor . The polynomial is reduced to the polynomial of degree 4

The lemma follows.
\end{proof}











\section{Algorithm} \label{algorithm}

In this Section we discuss how to modify the spring embedder in order to take into account 
the angles between embedded edges. 
Let  be an input graph. 
At the initial step the spring embedder randomly places the vertices of  in the plane.
Then, it iterates a simultaneous motion of the vertex positions based on
one or several forces (springs). 
We describe a new force using angle optimization.
For every vertex  with a position  in the plane, the algorithm computes 
a new position  and uses vector  as a force applied to vertex .




{\bf Angle Optimization Algorithm}\\
Input: Graph  embedded in the plane and radius .\\
Output: New embedding of graph  where each vertex is translated within distance .

For each vertex  do the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let  be the position of  in the plane. We compute  as follows. Every time   is assigned, we proceed to the next vertex .
\item If the degree of  is at most one then set .
\item Suppose that the degree of  is equal to two. Let  and  be the positions of vertices adjacent to . 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Suppose . Compute point  using Equations (\ref{qx}) and (\ref{qy}).  
If  then ; otherwise assign  to the endpoint of segment  that is closer to .
\item If  then set compute  using Proposition \ref{propdeg2a}. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Suppose that the degree of  is equal to three. 
Let , and  be the positions of vertices adjacent to .
Compute Fermat point  of triangle .
If  then set . Otherwise, 
for each segment , compute point  maximizing angle 
 (Section \ref{sectdeg2}). If angle  is the smallest angle from
 then set . 
Otherwise compute  as the best solution using two smallest angles for every two segments from  (Section \ref{twomin}). 
\item 
For the remaining vertices of degree at least four, apply the following grid approach.
Pick a grid stepsize , for example . 
Consider a grid with the origin at . For every grid point  with ,
compute the smallest angle  if  is moved to . Find  maximizing 
. Assign .
\end{enumerate}


We implemented this algorithm\footnote{Demo is available at 
\url{http://www.utdallas.edu/~sxb027100/soft/AngleOpt/}.} and run it on several graphs.
First, we tested the algorithm on graph  from \cite{rv-06} since it contains vertices of degree two.  The program draws  with angles optimized, see Figure \ref{t10} (b). 
It can be compared with the drawing of the original embedder \cite{embedder}, see
Figure \ref{t10} (a).

\caption{Graph  from \cite{rv-06}. (a) Drawing by Spring Embedder \cite{embedder}.

\label{t10}
\end{figure}

We also tested the algorithm on the phylogenetic networks for Algae example \cite{pb-opn-12}.
The drawing of the Algae network by  the spring embedder \cite{embedder} is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:algae}. It can be compared with our drawings in Figure \ref{algae}. 
In all drawings (in Figures \ref{fig:algae} and Figure \ref{algae}) the edge length constraints are
satisfied but the angle resolution in drawings in Figure \ref{algae} is significantly larger. 
The drawing shown in Figure \ref{algae} (a) uses the weighted version of the graph and the drawing in Figure \ref{algae} (b) uses the graph with  intermediate points on the edges.

Finally, we run our program on the well-known graphs: 
the Petersen graph \cite{hs-93}, the Heawood graph \cite{har-91}, and 
the Herschel graph \cite{bh-81}, see Figure \ref{well}.
The Petersen graph is drawn with two crossings (the Petersen graph is in fact the 
smallest 2-crossing cubic graph), see Figure \ref{well}(a).
The Heawood graph has crossing number three (it is actually the smallest 3-crossing cubic graph) and our program found a drawing with exactly three crossings, see Figure \ref{well}(b).

\section{Conclusion} \label{concl}

We proposed a novel approach to the problem of optimizing the angular resolution of a drawing. 
It has been applied to the spring embedder and the results with good angular resolution were obtained. It is known that the running time of the spring embedder can increase with the size of the graph. Therefore it is important to perform better the intermediate steps. The optimal solution of the MMA problem provides an opportunity to decrease the number of iterations of the spring embedder. 

The main result of this paper states that a vertex of degree at most three can be displaced optimally by solving a polynomial equation of degree at most four (which is interesting since the straightforward approach leads to a polynomial of degree six). A special case of MMA problem for degree three verices is the classical Fermat problem and the Fermat point is the solution for the special case. An interesting question for future research is to find the algebraic complexity of MMA problem for higher vertex degrees.
