\begin{abstract}
We introduce KPI-EDGAR, a novel dataset for Joint Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction building on financial reports uploaded to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, where the main objective is to extract Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from financial documents and link them to their numerical values and other attributes. We further provide four accompanying baselines for benchmarking potential future research. Additionally, we propose a new way of measuring the success of said extraction process by incorporating a word-level weighting scheme into the conventional F score to better model the inherently fuzzy borders of the entity pairs of a relation in this domain.

\section{Introduction}
Financial documents like income statements, business plans, initial public offering prospectuses, or whole annual financial reports hold a large amount of information for the reader willing to spend a considerable time reading through and analyzing them. Financial auditors are employed to check their validity and financial analysts utilize them to evaluate companies. Thus, creating an algorithm that automatically extracts information is likely to give the user a competitive edge by saving them extensive time usually spend on in-depth reading. 

Arguably, one of the most important pieces of information contained in such documents are key performance indicators (KPIs), which are defined as ``vital navigation instruments used by managers to
understand whether their business is on a successful voyage or whether it is veering off the
prosperous path'' \cite{marr2012key}, and are mostly quantitative measures. Well-known examples are revenue, profit, and loss.

In a previous paper, \cite{kpi-bert} introduced KPI-BERT, a system which employed novel methods of named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) to extract and link key performance indicators of companies from real-world German financial documents. This model was trained on undisclosed annotations in public financial documents owned by a major auditing company, and thus, unavailable to the research community.

To alleviate this flaw and to facilitate reproducibility as well as further research, we introduce KPI-EDGAR, a dataset based on publicly available data and manually annotated by us, with the main difference being that the language changed from German to English. It was collected from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system\footnote{At the time of writing, the EDGAR database can be accessed at this link:
\href{https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml}{sec.gov/edgar}}, usually shortened to EDGAR, which is maintained by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is made up of annual comprehensive financial reports, so-called \textit{10-K} reports.  It will be published with the release of this paper.

Furthermore, we present an adjusted F metric, that considers an entity and thus relation not as a unified, single object, but as a collection of words that should be evaluated as such. This is based on the observation that a relation extraction algorithm is often partly correct and missing only a minor part of the whole relation, regularly a rather unimportant word. The conventional F metric would still assign zero accuracy to this prediction, hence not reflecting the actual performance. These prediction errors probably stem from the fact that the word boundaries of a particular KPI might not be clearly defined and even financial auditors can be unsure where the exact confines of a KPI lie. To mitigate this issue, we incorporate a weighting scheme into the F metric to better capture these cases.

To sum up, our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We introduce a novel dataset, named KPI-EDGAR, for joint named entity recognition and relation extraction in the financial text domain based on actual corporate reports submitted to the EDGAR database. In contrast to other resources scraped from EDGAR (see \cite{han2016mining}, \cite{ashraf2017scraping}, \cite{loukas2021edgar}, and \cite{lonare2021edgar}), we provide manual annotations along with the corpus to allow for joint named entity recognition and relation extraction.
    \item We propose a new metric for measuring the performance of the relation extraction task to better capture when predictions are partially correct.
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We first review related work. In the next section, we describe our novel dataset, KPI-EDGAR, in detail and how it was gathered and pre-processed. 
Section \ref{section:methodology} defines the adjusted metric that incorporates a weighting scheme and introduces and specifies the four baselines we provide to researchers to benchmark their approaches. Thereafter, we evaluate these four baselines on KPI-EDGAR and report the conventional and adjusted F metric as well as a few example predictions to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the metric. We close this paper with concluding remarks and take an outlook into conceivable future work.

\section{Related Work}
Similar to our topic, many recent studies have focused on named entity recognition (\cite{lester2020constrained}, \cite{ushio2021t}, \cite{wang2021improving},  \cite{wang2021automated}), relation extraction (~\cite{xu2021entity}, \cite{zeng2020double}, \cite{zhangdocument}), and the joint combination of both (\cite{li2014incremental}, \cite{pappu2017lightweight}, \cite{eberts2019span}, \cite{liang2020bond}, \cite{shen2021trigger}, \cite{wang2020two}, \cite{ye2021pack}, \cite{zhong2021frustratingly}, \cite{tran2021improved}, \cite{hang2022joint}, \cite{savary2022relation}). Furthermore, \cite{fundel2007relex} as well as \cite{gurulingappa2012extraction} have shown that hierarchically using both tasks in a single pipeline can significantly improve the performance thus indicating that information from one task can be exploited by the other.
Additionally, methods described in recent publications are usually based on modern pre-trained natural language models (\cite{devlin2018bert}, \cite{liu2019roberta}, \cite{radford2018improving}, \cite{radford2019language}) and these methods have produced state-of-the-art results as expected.

For extracting information from financial reports, \cite{treigueiros1991application} provided pre-available accounting variables to a multilayer perceptron as input to build interpretable structures similar to accounting ratios. In comparison, \cite{farmakiotou2000rule} automatically extracted these variables and developed a NER model using a rule-based approach. \cite{brito2019hybrid} developed a hybrid AI tool that extracts KPIs by first detecting paragraphs and tables with computer vision techniques and then leverage supervised decision tree-based classifiers to accomplish the final extraction process.
 \cite{kpi-bert} applied a pre-trained language model combined with conditional label masking to extract key performance indicators from German financial reports. \cite{cao2018towards} used a joint entity and relation extraction approach to cross-check different financial formulas in Chinese documents.

Regarding the herein proposed metric, \cite{segura2013semeval} proposed a similar setup, but for Named Entity Recognition. Furthermore, \cite{fu2020interpretable} suggested dividing entities into buckets and evaluating the performance on each of these buckets.

Due to EDGAR's popularity, many researchers (\cite{han2016mining}, \cite{ashraf2017scraping}, \cite{lonare2021edgar}) have developed methods to extract data from EDGAR and used it in their own research. \cite{loukas2021edgar} even released a comprehensive corpus comprising annual reports from all the publicly traded companies in the US spanning a period of more than 25 years and accompanied it with a word2vec \cite{word2vec} model titled EDGAR--W2V, which we will also use as a baseline in our experiments. Furthermore, \cite{mustafaoglu2022lstm}, \cite{ryans2021textual}, and \cite{li2010information} have applied machine learning methods to EDGAR data and have provided useful results that can be used in real-world financial applications.

\section{Data}

Our overall dataset is comprised of 81 manually annotated \textit{10-K} reports, with a total of 1355 sentences holding 4522 entities and 3841 relations. A \textit{10-K} report is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly-traded company about its financial performance. The dataset was scraped from the EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) database, which is maintained by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and where all in the U.S. publicly listed companies have to submit a variety of financial reports.

As a first pre-processing step we tokenize the reports on a sentence level and then on a word level. Thereafter, we identify monetary values, the scale they are in (e.g. billion) and which currency unit is attached to it (usually U.S. Dollars) through rule-based string matching heuristics. This allows us to filter our reports for sentences containing such entities, as the focus of our dataset is to extract numeric monetary values and their corresponding key performance indicator. Given these sentences, we annotate word-level entities and relations. 

These annotations were generated by a team of four annotators, led by an auditing expert. The various entities and their annotations guideline, shown in Table \ref{tab:entities}, as well as the allowed relation matrix, which restricts which entities can be linked together, shown in Table \ref{tab:relations}, were defined in consultation with a wider team of auditors, who provided valuable feedback during the earlier stages of our project. After completing the annotations, the aforementioned senior auditing expert re-annotated 41 documents previously annotated by the other three annotators. 
The resulting inter-annotator agreement in terms of \textit{Cohen's Kappa}\footnote{The range of Cohen's Kappa lies between 1 (complete agreement of annotators) and -1 (complete disagreement of annotators), with 0 being no agreement between annotators or only what is to be expected by chance. See \cite{sim2005kappa} for an in-depth explanation on how to interpret \textit{Cohen's Kappa}.} \cite{cohen1960coefficient} on the word level is 0.7037. We further discuss this value and further insights regarding this inter-annotator agreement in Section~\ref{section:experiments} and the accompanying Table~\ref{tab:kappa}, which documents various \textit{Cohen's Kappa} scores.

\section{Methodology}
\label{section:methodology}

In this section, we shortly review the key points of KPI-BERT, a model tailored for key performance indicator extraction, introduced and illustrated in much greater detail in \cite{kpi-bert}
Thereafter, one span-level approach is briefly touched upon, namely the SpERT model introduced by \cite{eberts2019span}. 
We then provide two further baselines building on EDGAR--W2V \cite{loukas2021edgar} and GloVe \cite{pennington2014glove}, leveraging a similar setup like \cite{kpi-bert}.
These four models will be the baselines we provide to other researchers to benchmark their model against on KPI-EDGAR.

Finally, we describe our proposed adjustments to the prevalent F metric to better capture the actual performance of machine learning models on relation extraction from financial documents.

\subsection{KPI-BERT}
\label{subsection:kpibert}

The KPI-BERT \cite{kpi-bert} model has three main building blocks: A BERT-based Sentence Encoder, a Named Entity Recognition (NER) Decoder, and a Relation Extraction (RE) Decoder.

\label{tab:relations}
\end{table}

Given a WordPiece \cite{schuster2012japanese} tokenized input sentence we leverage a pre-trained BERT \cite{devlin2018bert} model to obtain our encoded token embedding. Thereafter, we apply a pooling function, which creates word representations by combining their individual subword embeddings. Both the more basic pooling functions \texttt{max} and \texttt{mean} as well as the specifically by \cite{kpi-bert} introduced  trainable recurrent neural network (RNN) pooling mechanism building on a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) \cite{cho2014properties} are evaluated in this context.

The NER decoder module classifies named entities within the sentence building on the IOBES annotation scheme. IOBES tagging functions by prepending all entity classes with the prefixes \textit{I-} (inside), \textit{B-} (begin), \textit{E-} (end) and \textit{S-} (single), or \textit{O} (outside) for tokens not belonging to the entity. Therefore, the number of possible IOBES entity tags is
 
where  is the number of entities, including the \textit{none} entity, as described in Table~\ref{tab:entities}. The inherently sequential nature of this task leads us to leverage a GRU in combination with conditional label masking to sequentially predict IOBES tags considering the previous predictions. 

To briefly elaborate, an embedding matrix  holding learnable -dimensional embeddings of all IOBES entity types is defined and is concatenated to pooled BERT word embeddings , yielding the decoding input representation of any word ,

where  is the embedding of the formerly predicted IOBES tag and  is defined as the \textit{O} (outside) label embedding.

Afterwards,  and the previous hidden state  is passed to a GRU, resulting in

We linearly transform  combined with masking out impossible tag predictions, e.g., an \textit{I} (inside) token without a previous \textit{B} (begin) token, and applying softmax to arrive at the IOBES tag predictions for word :


Finally, the RE Decoder takes the binary decision of whether two entities match or not. The entity sampling for this process is constrained by only passing allowed pairs, as defined in Table \ref{tab:relations}, to the decoder. The inputs to this decoder are the embeddings, defined for each entity  as

where  and  is a span size embedding, which is taken from an embedding matrix  holding fixed-size learned embeddings of dimensionality .

\subsection{Span-Level Baseline}
\label{subsection:spert}

At the core of this model, we utilize the same architecture as shown in \cite{eberts2019span}, where they titled the model SpERT, which we will use for this approach as well. Passing a byte-pair encoded input sentence of length  through BERT \cite{devlin2018bert}, we obtain  token embeddings, , where  represents the context embedding for the whole sentence. 

In contrast to the approaches in sections \ref{subsection:kpibert} and \ref{subsection:furtherbaselines}, we classify entire entity spans instead of individual tokens. Thus, we create all possible token subsequences from the encoded BERT output, up to a maximum span length , set to  to keep true to the original configuration of \cite{eberts2019span}. For example, given the input \texttt{(alea iacta est)} we form the spans \texttt{(alea)}, \texttt{(iacta)}, \texttt{(est)}, \texttt{(alea, iacta)}, \texttt{(iacta, est)}, \texttt{(alea, iacta, est)}. Thereafter, each span is classified into entity types, and each possible entity pair receives a prediction whether or not it is linked together. 

Different from \cite{eberts2019span}, we additionally filter overlapping entity spans by removing the ones with a lower classification score, as overlapping spans are simply not possible in our application of extracting KPI's from financial documents. To illustrate, take the example above and let us assume that the span \texttt{(alea)} and \texttt{(alea, iacta)} are both classified as an entity, the first with a score of 0.75 and the latter with 0.5. In this approach, we would only keep the entity \texttt{(alea)}.

\subsection{Further Token-Level Baselines}
\label{subsection:furtherbaselines}

As defined in the methodology section \ref{section:methodology}, the introduced joint NER and RE model consists of three building blocks: a sentence encoder, NER decoder, and RE decoder. For generating further baselines, the sentence encoder of the described model is replaced by EDGAR--W2V \cite{loukas2021edgar} and GloVe \cite{pennington2014glove}.
The rest of the architecture is left unchanged. For these baselines, the sentences are tokenized into words and not WordPiece tokens. 


The word embeddings are extracted from the available pre-trained embeddings uploaded by their respective authors. For those words which are not present in the vocabulary, a random vector is used as a substitute. 

\subsection{Adjusted F Metric}
\label{subsection:adjustedf1}

To better capture the actual performance of predictions during the relation extraction from financial documents, we introduce an adjusted F metric that allows for relations to be partially correct.

Given the following example sentence and ground truth relations from a financial document,
\begin{tcolorbox}[notitle,boxrule=0pt,

This study is part of a larger endeavor and long-time research project to advance information extraction processes in the financial text domain, where both machine learning researchers and audit experts work together on finding novel solutions to practical issues encountered during the audit process. In its wake, we plan to further improve availability, quality, and quantity of datasets. 
As a logical next step, we intend to build a named entity recognition dataset based on available GAAP (general accepted accounting principle) entities from the EDGAR database. Given the massive amount of freely available financial reports on EDGAR, it is also conceivable to train a custom language model tailored to handle such financial documents, as shown with EDGAR--W2V \cite{loukas2021edgar} but with a state-of-the-art transformer model like BERT \cite{devlin2018bert}. Additionally, in a further push to improve performance tracking, we will investigate dynamic ways to weight the metric, e.g., by incorporating the importance of each word that is part of an entity and relation.
