We implement \ourmethod{} for three motion generation tasks: Text-to-Motion(\ref{sec:t2m}), Action-to-Motion(\ref{sec:a2m}) and unconditioned generation(\ref{sec:uncond}. Each sub-section reviews the data and metrics of the used benchmarks, provides implementation details, and presents qualitative and quantitative results. Then, we show implementations of motion in-betweening (both conditioned and unconditioned) and body-part editing by adapting diffusion inpainting to motion (\ref{sec:edit}).
Our models have been trained with  noising steps and a cosine noise schedule.
All of them have been trained on a single \textit{NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti} GPU for a period of about  days.

\subsection{Text-to-Motion}
\label{sec:t2m}
\vspace{-5pt}

Text-to-motion is the task of generating motion given an input text prompt. The output motion is expected to be both implementing the textual description, and a valid sample from the data distribution (i.e. adhering to general human abilities and the rules of physics). In addition, for each text prompt, we also expect a distribution of motions matching it, rather than just a single result. We evaluate our model using two leading benchmarks - KIT~\citep{plappert2016kit} and HumanML3D~\citep{guo2022generating}, over the set of metrics suggested by \citet{guo2022generating}: 
 \textit{R-precision} and \textit{Multimodal-Dist} measure the relevancy of the generated motions to the input prompts, \textit{FID} measures the dissimilarity between the generated and ground truth distributions (in latent space), \textit{Diversity} measures the variability in the resulting motion distribution, and \textit{MultiModality} is the average variance given a single text prompt. For the full implementation of the metrics, please refer to \citet{guo2022generating}.
We use HumanML3D as a platform to compare different backbones of our model, discovering that the diffusion framework is relatively agnostic to this attribute.
In addition, we conduct a user study comparing our model to current art and ground truth motions. 

\textbf{Data.}
HumanML3D is a recent dataset, textually re-annotating motion capture from the AMASS~\citep{AMASS:ICCV:2019} and HumanAct12~\citep{guo2020action2motion} collections. 
It contains  motions annotated by  textual descriptions.
In addition, it suggests a redundant data representation including a concatenation of root velocity, joint positions, joint velocities, joint rotations and the foot contact binary labels. We also use in this section the same representation for the KIT dataset, brought by the same publishers. 
Although limited in the number () and the diversity of samples, most of the text-to-motion research is based on KIT, hence we view it as important to evaluate using it as well. 

\textbf{Implementation.}
In addition to our Transformer encoder-only backbone (Section~\ref{sec:method}), we experiment \ourmethod{} with three more backbones: (1) \textit{Transformer decoder} injects  through the cross-attention layer, instead of as an input token. (2) \textit{Transformer decoder + input token}, where  is injected both ways, and (3) \textit{GRU}~\citep{cho2014learning} concatenate  to each input frame (Table~\ref{tab:humanml3d}). 
Our models were trained with batch size ,  layers (except GRU that was optimal at ), and latent dimension . To encode the text we use a frozen \textit{CLIP-ViT-B/32} model.
Each model was trained for  steps, afterwhich a checkpoint was chosen that minimizes the FID metric to be reported. Since foot contact and joint locations are explicitly represented in HumanML3D, we don't apply geometric losses in this section. We evaluate our models with guidance-scale  which provides a diversity-fidelity sweet spot (Figure~\ref{fig:user_study_and_sweep}).


\textbf{Quantitative evaluation.} We evaluate and compare our models to current art (JL2P~\citet{ahuja2019language2pose}, Text2Gesture~\citep{bhattacharya2021text2gestures}, and T2M~\citep{guo2022generating}) with the metrics suggested by \citet{guo2022generating}. 
As can be seen, \ourmethod{} achieves state-of-the-art results in \textit{FID}, \textit{Diversity}, and \textit{MultiModality}, indicating high diversity per input text prompt, and high-quality samples, as can also be seen qualitatively in Figure~\ref{fig:teaser}.

\textbf{User study.} We asked 31 users to choose between \ourmethod{} and 
state-of-the-art works
in a side-by-side view, with both samples generated from the same text prompt randomly sampled from the KIT test set. We repeated this process with 10 samples per model and 10 repetitions per sample. 
This user study enabled a comparison with the recent TEMOS model~\citep{petrovich22temos}, which was not included in the HumanML3D benchmark.
Fig.~\ref{fig:user_study_and_sweep} shows that most of the time, \ourmethod{} was preferred over the compared models, and even preferred over ground truth samples in  of the cases.

\subsection{Action-to-Motion}
\vspace{-5pt}

\label{sec:a2m}
Action-to-motion is the task of generating motion given an input action class, represented by a scalar. The output motion should faithfully animate the input action, and at the same time be natural and reflect the distribution of the dataset on which the model is trained. Two dataset are commonly used to evaluate action-to-motion models: HumanAct12~\citep{guo2020action2motion} and UESTC~\citep{ji2018large}. We evaluate our model using the set of metrics suggested by \citet{guo2020action2motion}, namely Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID), action recognition accuracy, diversity and multimodality. The combination of these metrics makes a good measure of the realism and diversity of generated motions.

\textbf{Data.}
HumanAct12~\citep{guo2020action2motion} offers approximately 1200 motion clips, organized into 12 action categories, with 47 to 218 samples per label. 
UESTC~\citep{ji2018large} consists of 40 action classes, 40 subjects and 25K samples, and is split to train and test. 
We adhere to the cross-subject testing protocol used by current works, with 225-345 samples per action class.
For both datasets we use the sequences provided by \citet{petrovich21actor}.

\textbf{Implementation.}
The implementation presented in Figure~\ref{fig:overview} holds for all the variations of our work. In the case of action-to-motion, the only change would be the substitution of the text embedding by an action embedding. Since action is represented by a scalar, its embedding is fairly simple; each input action class scalar is converted into a learned embedding of the transformer dimension.

The experiments have been run with batch size , a latent dimension of , and an encoder-transformer architecture. Training on HumanAct12 and UESTC has been carried out for  and  steps respectively. In our tables we display the evaluation of the checkpoint that minimizes the FID metric. 

\textbf{Quantitative evaluation.}
Tables \ref{tab:humanact12} and \ref{tab:uestc} reflect \ourmethod{}'s performance on the HumanAct12 and UESTC datasets respectively. We conduct 20 evaluations, with 1000 samples in each, and report their average and a 95\% confidence interval.
We test two variations, with and without foot contact loss.
Our model leads the board for both datasets. 
The variation with no foot contact loss attains slightly better results; nevertheless, as shown in our supplementary video, the contribution of foot contact loss to the quality of results is important, and without it we witness artifacts such as shakiness and unnatural gestures.

\section{Additional Applications}
\vspace{-5pt}
\subsection{Motion Editing} \label{sec:edit}
\vspace{-5pt}

In this section we implement two motion editing applications - \textbf{in-betweening} and \textbf{body part editing}, both using the same approach in the temporal and spatial domains correspondingly. 
For \textbf{in-betweening}, we fix the first and last  of the motion, leaving the model to generate the remaining  in the middle. For \textbf{body part editing}, we fix the joints we don't want to edit and leave the model to generate the rest. In particular, we experiment with editing the upper body joints only.
In figure~\ref{fig:edit} we show that in both cases, using the method described in Section~\ref{sec:method} generates smooth motions that adhere both to the fixed part of the motion and the condition (if one was given).

\textbf{Bold} indicates best result.}
\label{tab:unconstrained}
\end{table}
 \vspace{-5pt}
\subsection{Unconstrained Synthesis} \label{sec:uncond}
\vspace{-5pt}
The challenging task of unconstrained synthesis has been studied by only a few~\citep{holden2016deep, raab2022modi}. 
In the presence of data labeling, e.g., action classes or text description, the labels work as a supervising factor, and facilitate a structured latent space for the training network. 
The lack of labeling make training more difficult.
The human motion field possesses rich unlabeled datasets~\citep{mixamo}, and the ability to train on top of them is an advantage.
Daring to test \ourmethod{} in the challenging unconstrained setting, we follow MoDi\citep{raab2022modi} for evaluation. We use the metrics they suggest (FID, KID, precision/recall and multimodality), and run on an unconstrained version of the HumanAct12~\citep{guo2020action2motion} dataset.

\textbf{Data.}
Although annotated, we use HumanAct12 (see Section \ref{sec:a2m}) in an unconstrained fashion, ignoring its labels. The choice of HumanAct12 rather than a dataset with no labels (e.g., Mixamo~\citep{mixamo}), is for compatibility with previous publications. 

\textbf{Implementation.}
Our model uses the same architecture for all forms of conditioning, as well as for the unconstrained setting.
The only change to the structure shown in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}, is the removal of the conditional input, such that  is composed of the projection of  only.
To simulate an unconstrained behavior, ACTOR~\citet{petrovich21actor} has been trained by \citep{raab2022modi} with a labeling of one class to all motions.


\textbf{Quantitative evaluation.}
The results of our evaluation are shown in table \ref{tab:unconstrained}.
We demonstrate superiority over works that were not designed for an unconstrained setting, and get closer to MoDi~\citep{raab2022modi}. MoDi is carefully molded for unconstrained settings, while our work can be applied to any (or no) constrain, and also provides editing capabilities.
