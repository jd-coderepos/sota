\begin{abstract}
The \emph{metric dimension} of a graph is the size of the smallest set of vertices whose distances distinguish all pairs of vertices in the graph. We show that this graph invariant may be calculated by an algorithm whose running time is linear in the input graph size, added to a function of the largest possible number of leaves in a spanning tree of the graph.

\section{Introduction}

Since its initial formulation, the theory of parameterized complexity has had great success in developing algorithms for -hard problems that are general enough to handle all inputs, that are fast on inputs of low complexity (as measured by the parameter of interest), and that degrade gracefully as this parameter increases. For instance, by Courcelle's theorem, a large number of graph properties have fixed-parameter tractable algorithms when parameterized by treewidth~\cite{Cou-IC-90}; these algorithms have running time bounds that are linear in the size of the graph, multiplied by non-polynomial functions of the treewidth. An even larger class of problems (essentially, all monotone graph properties) have fixed-parameter tractable algorithms when parameterized by tree-depth~\cite{NesOss-12}.
Nevertheless, for some important graph problems and parameters, fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with these parameters are unknown or (if standard complexity-theoretic assumptions hold) provably do not exist.  One example of this phenomenon is given by the \emph{metric dimension} of a given graph~\cite{HarMel-AC-76}.

\begin{definition}
A  \emph{locating set} (or \emph{metric basis}) for a graph  is a set  of vertices with the property that, for every two vertices  and  in , there exists a vertex  such that  and  have different distances to . The \emph{metric dimension} of~ is the minimum cardinality of a locating set for~.
\end{definition}

Thus, the locating set gives a set of landmarks that can be used for unambiguous navigation in~, and the metric dimension counts the number of landmarks that are necessary for this purpose~\cite{KhuRagRos-DAM-96}.
The graphs for which the metric dimension is bounded may be recognized in polynomial time, by an obvious brute-force search algorithm that tests whether each tuple with the given size bound is a locating set. Generalizing an algorithm for metric dimension in trees~\cite{HarMel-AC-76}, the metric dimension may also be computed in polynomial time for graphs of bounded \emph{cyclomatic number} (the minimum number of edges the removal of which breaks all cycles)~\cite{EpsLevWoe-WG-12}. However, the exponents of these algorithms depend on their parameters, so they are not fixed-parameter tractable, and the problem does not seem to fit into the standard classes of problems that may be solved efficiently for graphs of bounded treewidth~\cite{DiaPotSer-ESA-12} or tree-depth. Additionally, the metric dimension of a graph is complete for ~\cite{HarNic-CCC-13}, again implying that it is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable for its natural parameter. This negative result implies that, in order to find fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for this problem, we must search for weaker parameters that better distinguish the easy instances of these problems from the hard ones.

\label{fig:TTC}
\end{figure}

In this paper, we find such a result, parameterized by the \emph{max leaf number} of a graph.  Our algorithms are particularly efficient for graphs with many degree-two vertices and few vertices of other degrees, which are common for instance in subway and train systems (Figure~\ref{fig:TTC}).

\begin{definition}
The \emph{max leaf number} of a connected graph~ is the maximum, over all spanning trees of~, of the number of leaves in the spanning tree.
\end{definition}

The max leaf number of~ can equivalently be defined as the maximum number of leaves in a star  that is a minor of~, because contracting the interior edges of a tree with  leaves leads to a star minor~\cite{FelLan-SJDM-92}. It also equals the maximum degree of a minor of~. Because of these equivalent definitions, the max leaf number is minor-monotone. 
Testing whether the max leaf number is at most a given threshold is -complete~\cite[ND4, p. 206]{GarJoh-79} but the max leaf number is fixed-parameter tractable with its natural parameter~\cite{FelLan-SJDM-92} and parameterized algorithms for computing it have been the subject of extensive algorithmic research (see e.g. Fernau \emph{et al.}~\cite{FerJoaDie-TCS-11} and their references).
After an initial investigation by Fellows et al.~\cite{FelLokNus-TCS-09},
the max leaf number has by now become one of the standard choices for parameterizing algorithms for other graph problems~\cite{AdiChiSau-ISAAC-10,BodJanKra-TCS-13,FelHerRos-ESA-13,Lam-Algo-12,Lam-LMCS-14}.

\section{Max leaf number versus branches}

Rather than parameterizing our algorithms directly by the max leaf number, it will be convenient for us to instead use a different but (as we prove) functionally equivalent parameter, the number of \emph{branches} in the given graph.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{branch} of a graph  is a maximal path or cycle in which every internal vertex of the path has degree two in . A vertex~ \emph{belongs} to a branch if  is incident to an edge of the branch and it is not incident to edges of any other branches.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:branch-upper-bound-by-leaf}
In any connected graph with max leaf number , there can be at most  branches.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We prove in the opposite direction that if there are  branches then there is a tree with  leaves.
So, suppose that we have a connected graph  with  branches.
We partition into cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose that at least  of these branches end in a degree-one vertex.
Then contracting all the other branches leaves a tree with at least  leaves.
\item If we are not in the previous case, form a graph  (the 2-core of~) by recursively removing all degree-one branches from . There can be  removed branches, and each removed branch may cause two remaining branches to merge, so  has  branches. Let  be the number of vertices in  of degree three or more. If , then at least one of these vertices must have  branches incident to it, giving a tree with  leaves.
\item In the remaining case, we have  branches in  and  vertices of degree three or more. Contracting each branch of  to a single edge forms a graph with  vertices, each of which has degree at least three. A classical theorem of Kleitman and West~\cite{KleWes-SJDM-91} implies that the contracted graph has a tree with  leaves. Undoing the contraction results in a tree with the same number of leaves in  itself.
\end{itemize}
Thus in every case  has max leaf number 
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
A complete graph  has max leaf number  and   branches. This example shows that \autoref{lem:branch-upper-bound-by-leaf} is asymptotically tight.
\end{example} 

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:leaf-upper-bound-by-branch}
Every connected graph with  branches has max leaf number at most .
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If a graph  has max leaf number , then it has a tree  with  leaves, and therefore (if ) it has at least  branches. Each branch of  can give rise to at most two branches of~, so the number  of branches of~ obeys the inequality . The case when  is even easier, for  in this case the graph must be a path with  and .
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:equiv-params}
Any graph algorithm that is fixed-parameter tractable for max leaf number is fixed-parameter tractable for the number of branches, and vice versa.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from \autoref{lem:branch-upper-bound-by-leaf} and \autoref{lem:leaf-upper-bound-by-branch}.
\end{proof}

\section{Metric dimension}

With these preliminaries about numbers of branches in hand, we are ready to start describing our algorithm for the metric dimension.

\subsection{Indistinct sets}

In a graph with a small number of branches, a single vertex in a locating set will necessary distinguish most of the pairs of vertices in the graph.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:monotonic}
Let  be a graph,  be a branch of , and  be any vertex of . Then  may be partitioned into at most three contiguous paths within which the distance from  is monotonic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If  is not within , then let  be the point of  where distance from  is largest. Then splitting  into two paths at  necessarily gives two contiguous paths on which the distance is monotonic: neither path can contain a local minimum of distance, because the only possible such point within a path is  itself, and neither path can contain a local maximum, because there would have to be a local minimum between any local maximum and~.

If  is within , then split  into three paths at  and at the point  where distance from  is largest. The two paths ending at  are monotone for the same reason as before. The third path, from  to the other endpoint  of , must also be monotone. For, if it had a local maximum at a point , then the shortest path from  to  would be shorter than both of the paths from  to  and  to , and would therefore have to avoid both  and , but there is no path in  from  to  that avoids both  and .
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let  be a graph, with  and  being two of its branches, and let  be a vertex in a locating set for .
Then the \emph{indistinct set} for , , and  is defined to be the set of pairs  of vertices  with  and  with . We do not require  and  to be distinct, so  is allowed in this definition.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Let  be a graph, with  and  being two of its branches, and let  be a vertex in a locating set for .
Then the indistinct set for , , and  has size  .
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \autoref{lem:monotonic} the vertices in  and in  may be divided into at most three paths per branch, within which the distance from  is monotonic.
Therefore, there are  points in both  and  that have a given distance  from ,
and only  pairs of one point from  and one point from  that both have this distance.
The total number of pairs that are not distinguished is the sum of this  bound over
the at most  different distances that need to be distinguished.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{indistinct}
\caption{Two branches  and  arranged by their distances from a locating point  (left), and their indistinct set (of pairs not distinguished by ) plotted using the positions in the branches as Cartesian coordinates (right).}
\label{fig:indistinct}
\end{figure}

When plotted in two dimensions, with the position of  in  as one Cartesian coordinate and the position of  in  as the other, an indistinct set has the structure of  line segments with slopes  (\autoref{fig:indistinct}). By rotating this coordinate system by  we may use a more convenient coordinate system in which these segments are all horizontal or vertical, rather than diagonal. However, we must be careful when using this rotated system: only half of the integer points (the ones with even sums of coordinates) correspond to the integer points in the un-rotated system, which are the only points that can be members of an indistinct set.

\begin{observation}
Set  is a valid locating set if, for every pair of branches  and , the different indistinct sets for the different points in  have an empty intersection.
\end{observation}

\subsection{Stems}
Now, consider how the indistinct set of ,  and   changes as the position of  varies along a third branch  in the given graph.

\begin{definition}
We say that two indistinct sets are \emph{combinatorially equivalent} if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the diagonal segments of the two sets with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item If  is a diagonal of one indistinct set, then the corresponding diagonal in the other set has the same slope as .
\item If  and  are two diagonals of one indistinct set that intersect each other, then the corresponding diagonals in the other set also intersect each other.
\item If , , and  are three diagonals of one indistinct set, with  and  both intersecting~, then the corresponding two intersections of diagonals in the other intersecting set have the same (northwest-to-southeast or northeast-to-southwest) ordering.
\end{itemize}
Combinatorial equivalence is an equivalence relation and we define the \emph{combinatorial structure} of an indistinct set to be its equivalence class in this equivalence relation.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
We define a \emph{stem} to be a maximal contiguous subset of a branch  of the given graph  within which the indistinct sets of all points  in  and all pairs  of branches have the same combinatorial structure.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:const-breaks}
For a given pair of branches  and a third branch , there are  positions along  such that the indistinct set of a vertex  of  and the pair  changes structure at that position.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The structure changes only at two types of position along :
\begin{itemize}
\item positions where the shortest path from  to an endpoint of  or  switches from going through one end of  to going through the other, and
\item positions where the endpoints of the two branches  and  and the points of maximum distance from  change their relative positions in the arrangement by distance from .
\end{itemize}
There are two possibilities for the shortest path from  to a given endpoint  of  or : it must consist of a path in  from  to one endpoint of  together with the shortest path in  from that endpoint of  to . These two paths can change their ordering only once as  moves along . Therefore, each endpoint of  or  contributes at most four breakpoints of the first type.

Because it has only one breakpoint of the first type, each endpoint of  or  has a distance from  that (as a function of the position of  along ) is piecewise linear with only one breakpoint. By similar reasoning, the distance from  to the farthest point within  or  is also piecewise linear with  breakpoints. Therefore, in the arrangement by distance, these points can exchange positions only  times.
\end{proof}

At all points of  other than these, the indistinct set for , , and  maintains the same combinatorial structure.  The positions of its segments either remain fixed as  varies along the path, or they shift linearly with the position of  along .

\begin{lemma}
Every graph  with ~branches has  stems.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
There are  pairs of branches, each of which (by \autoref{lem:const-breaks}) contributes  breakpoints to branch , so each branch has  stems and there are  stems in the whole graph.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The algorithm}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:locating-set-upper-bound}
The metric dimension of every graph with  branches is .
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A set  that includes the endpoints of all branches and an interior point of each branch is certainly a valid locating set, and has .
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The metric dimension of any graph with  vertices and  branches may be determined in time .
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We may assume without loss of generality that the graph is connected, for otherwise we could partition it into connected components and process each component separately.
Partitioning the graph into branches may be performed in time . After this step all shortest path computations in the given graph can be performed by instead using a weighted graph with  vertices and edges, in which each edge represents a branch of the original graph and is weighted by that branch's length. In particular, after partitioning the graph into branches, we may partition the branches into stems in total time~.

We search for locating sets of size  (according to \autoref{lem:locating-set-upper-bound})
by choosing nondeterministically the number of vertices in the locating set , and the stem containing each vertex (but not the location of the vertex within the stem). There are  possible choices of this type. This choice determines the combinatorial structure of each indistinct set.

Next, for each pair  of branches (allowing ) and each member  of the locating set (now associated with a specific stem but not placed at a particular vertex within that stem), we consider the line segments forming the indistinct sets for ,  and , in the rotated coordinate system for which these line segments are horizontal and vertical. For a given pair  there are  line segments ( for each member of the locating set) and each line segment may be specified by the two Cartesian coordinate pairs for its endpoints. Rather than choosing these coordinate values numerically, we choose nondeterministically the sorted order of the -coordinates and similarly the sorted order of the -coordinates, allowing ties in our nondeterministic choices. In other words, separately for the  and  coordinates, we select a weak ordering of the segment endpoints, specifying for any two segment endpoints whether they have equal coordinate values or, if not, which one has a smaller coordinate value than the other.
We also choose nondeterministically the parity of each Cartesian coordinate.
Each of the  pairs of branches has  choices for these orderings and parities, so there are  possible nondeterministic choices overall.
For each such choice and each pair  we verify that, if we can find a placement of the vertices of the locating set that gives rise to the chosen sorted orderings, then the intersection of the indistinct sets for  and  will not contain any integer points (in the un-rotated coordinate system).

To test whether two indistinct sets have a non-empty intersection, we test each pair of a line segment from one set and a line segment from the other set for an intersection.
Two horizontal line segments intersect each other if and only if they have the same -coordinate and overlapping intervals of -coordinates; a symmetric calculation is valid for two vertical line segments. A horizontal line segment intersects a vertical line segment if and only if the -coordinate of the horizontal segment is within the range of -coordinates of the vertical segment, the -coordinate of the vertical segment is within the range of -coordinates of the horizontal segment, and the parities of the coordinates of the two segments cause their crossing point to land on an integer point rather than on a half-integer point. In this way, the existence of an intersection point can be determined in time polynomial in , using only the information about the sorted order and parities of coordinates that we have chosen nondeterministically.

When these nondeterministic choices find a collection of indistinct sets, and a sorted ordering of the features of those sets, for which every pair of branches has an empty intersection of indistinct sets, it remains to determine whether there exists a placement of each locating set vertex within its stem, in order to cause the indistinct set features to have the sorted orders that we have already chosen. Each ordering constraint between two features that are consecutive in one of the sorted orders translates directly to a linear constraint between the positions of two locating set vertices  and  within their stems; therefore, the problem of finding positions that satisfy all of these constraints can be formulated and solved as an integer linear programming feasability problem, with  variables (the positions of the locating vertices on their stems) and  constraints (sorted orderings of  items for each of  pairs of branches, specified with numbers of  bits (the lengths of the stems).
By standard algorithms for low-dimensional integer linear programming problems, this problem can be solved in time .~\cite{Len-MOR-83,Kan-MOR-87,FraTar-Comb-87,Cla-JACM-95}.

The product of the numbers of nondeterministic choices made by the algorithm with the time for integer linear programming for each choice gives the stated time bound.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The metric dimension of a graph with max leaf number  may be determined in time .
\end{corollary}

\section{Conclusions}

We have shown that metric dimension is fixed-parameter tractable in the max leaf number, but our algorithms have time bounds that are too high to be practical. It would therefore be of interest to reduce this dependence, for instance to be singly-exponential in the max leaf number.

It would also be of interest to extend this method to stronger parameters. For instance, the fact that the metric dimension is relatively easy on trees~\cite{HarMel-AC-76} makes it plausible that, for general graphs, we could reduce the problem to one on the 2-core of the graph (the subgraph that remains after repeatedly removing degree-one vertices). The branch-count of the 2-core of any graph is proportional to the graph's cyclomatic number, so such a result would mean that the metric dimension could be computed in fixed-parameter tractable time in the cyclomatic number. Is this possible?
