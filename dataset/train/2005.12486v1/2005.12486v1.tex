This further justifies our claim of mutual guidance between two modules and the proposed alternate training strategy.

\section{Conclusion}
We presents RATE-Net, a novel framework for synthesizing person images with sharp texture details. 
Instead of simply warping the patches from the source image with the risk of losing fine-grained texture details, we proposed to synthesize new textures with additional texture enhancing module that helps add more visual details to the coarse pose transfer results. Furthermore, an effective training strategy is proposed to alternately update the two modules for better overall performance. Compared with previous works, our framework can synthesize human images with much finer details, and can better preserve the style and appearance of the source image.
We believe the idea behind our framework can inspire other related topics in semantic image synthesis as well.
