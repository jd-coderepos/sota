\begin{abstract}
In this paper we use optimization-based methods to design output-feedback controllers for a class of one-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations. The output may be distributed or point-measurements. The input may be distributed or boundary actuation. We use Lyapunov operators, duality, and the Luenberger observer framework to reformulate the synthesis problem as a convex optimization problem expressed as a set of Linear-Operator-Inequalities (LOIs). We then show how feasibility of these LOIs may be tested using Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and the Sum-of-Squares methodology.

\section{Introduction}

Parabolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are a simple class of system used to model processes such as diffusion, transport and reaction.  Some examples of systems which have been modelled using Parabolic PDEs include plasma in a tokamak~\cite{witrant2007control}, heat propagation, and spatial dynamics of population in an ecosystem~\cite{murray2002mathematical}. Despite the wide variety of physical phenomena modeled by partial-differential equations, our knowledge of how to control these systems is underdeveloped. While much attention has focused on the use of advanced computing strategies for simulation of partial-differential equations, relatively little work has focused on the development of numerical methods for control of PDEs. This is in particular contrast to the state of the art for linear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), wherein Linear Matrix Inequalities and Convex optimization have been used to resolve a vast array of long-standing problems - e.g. -optimal output feedback. The goal of this paper, then, is to attempt to extend some of the computational methods for control of linear ODEs to control of linear PDEs.


Differential models incorporating multiple independent variables (e.g. time and space) have been around since the time of Newton. Indeed, many of the models we use today date from this time - e.g. D'Alembert and the wave equation; the Euler-Bernoulli beam; The Euler Equations. Although research into PDEs over the past century has mainly focused on constructing analytic or numerical solutions to these systems, an effort has also been made to define a framework for control. One facet of this research into defining a framework for control of PDEs has been to define a general class of forward-time PDE systems using the label of ``strongly-continuous semigroup''. For such systems, existence and continuity of solutions is guaranteed for bounded feedback operators. See~\cite{curtain1995introduction,bensoussan1995representation,
hale1971functional,lasiecka2000control} for several excellent volumes on this subject.
One of the advantages of a well-defined state-space is the ability to use Lyapunov analysis to prove properties of the state. Indeed, application of Lyapunov theory to infinite-dimensional systems has been studied for some time - See early results in~\cite{krasovskistability,datko1970extending,baker1969lyapunov}.


PDE models of control can vary significantly based on the type of PDE, boundary conditions, measurements, etc. Unlike ODE systems, these differences may dramatically alter the definition of state and other mathematical properties of the solution. For instance, control of PDEs can be classified as either distributed input or boundary/point input. For distributed inputs, the control effort is spread over some measurable subset of the domain. For boundary/point inputs, the input precisely determines the state at a collection of points of zero measure. An example of a distributed input is RF heating of a plasma in a tokamak~\cite{bribiesca2011strict}.  Examples of point actuation include a thermostat in HVAC regulation or the speaker in noise-cancelling headphones. In a similar manner, output may also be classified using either distributed or boundary/point measurements. A more subtle distinction is the classification as hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic - a distinction determined by the number and type of partial derivatives. Additionally, we distinguish between isotropic and anisotropic systems. In isotropic systems, independent variables (spatial or temporal) do not appear in the coefficients, whereas the anisotropic form allows such dependence. Examples of anisotropic systems include heat conduction with non-homogeneous/time-varying conductive properties or a wave propagating through a medium of varying density. Finally, we classify the boundary conditions using terms such as Neumann/Dirichlet/Robin/etc. to denote which boundary points are specified or controlled. Classification of boundary conditions has a significant influence on the existence and mathematical properties of the solution~\cite{lions1972non}.

In this paper we focus on the more difficult case of point actuation of a single-state anisotropic parabolic partial-differential equation in a single spatial variable using point observations and non-homogeneous boundary conditions.

There has been significant recent effort to understand and solve the problem of optimal control for PDE systems of this form. For instance,~\cite{van1993h} solved certain distributed input/distributed output optimal control problems using infinite-dimensional Ricatti equations. Additionally,~\cite{lasiecka2000control} and related work considered the problem of point actuation using Ricatti Equations and also discusses potential numerical methods for solving these equations. In~\cite{lasiecka1994control}, an extension of this approach to output feedback through the use of a Luenberger observer is developed. One relatively popular and practical method for controlling parabolic PDE systems has been backstepping~\cite{krstic2008boundary} and its numerous extensions (e.g.~\cite{krstic2008adaptive,smyshlyaev2007adaptive,smyshlyaev2007adaptive2,smyshlyaev2006lyapunov}). This method is attractive due to its straightforward explanation and implementation. However, it does have drawbacks including suboptimality due to the fixed structure of the controller and Lyapunov function.
Additionally, we note some other recent use of Lyapunov functions for analysis and control of infinite dimensional systems including: a rotating beam~\cite{coron1998stabilization}; quasilinear hyperbolic systems~\cite{coron2008dissipative}; and control of systems governed by conservation laws \cite{coron2007strict}.

Alternatively, Sturm-Liouville theory can also be used to devise stabilizing controllers for the class of PDEs we consider. In particular, the problem of searching for the eigenvalues of the differential operators defining the PDEs under consideration can be cast as a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem. Thus, the eigenvalues of the differential operators can be found and consequently, stability properties can be inferred. Moreover, using the same approach, static output feedback controllers which stabilize the PDEs can also be found. Albeit relatively more complicated, the methodology presented in this work has various advantages over the Sturm-Liouville approach, chiefly among which is that we use Lyapunov functionals to achieve our results. Due to this, the presented work can be generalized to construct robust controllers for not only the systems under consideration, but also for nonlinear and uncertain PDEs. Moreover, the numerical examples provided in the paper show that the presented methodology is more effective in constructing stabilizing controllers.    


To summarize, although there are a number of methods for control of PDEs, none of them are an ideal solution in the sense that if a controller exists, we have a practical and numerically efficient way to find it. Some previous work in this direction includes the use of Sum-of-Squares for stability analysis of nonlinear PDEs in~\cite{papachristodoulou2005constructing} and was applied to fluid-flow in~\cite{tanaka2009sum}. Additionally, the use of LMIs for stability analysis of semilinear parabolic and hyperbolic systems can be found in \cite{fridman2009lmi}.
The results presented in this paper are a further step towards that ideal solution in the sense that the conditions are convex (meaning they are tractable) and asymptotically accurate (meaning that for any desired accuracy, we can find a convex set of conditions).

Specifically, in this paper, we consider a linear 1-D parabolic partial-differential equation with spatially- and temporally-varying coefficients. We focus on point actuation of Neumann-type boundary conditions, although the use of Dirichlet, Robin, or distributed inputs is also discussed. Our approach to controller synthesis is to use the semigroup framework to formulate the controller synthesis problem as a set of linear operator inequalities. These operator inequalities represent the conditions for existence of a decreasing quadratic Lyapunov function. For point observation, we use the Luenberger observer framework to construct additional inequalities which define the observer. Once we have defined our operator inequalities, we parameterize the set of solutions using operators with polynomial multipliers and kernels. This parametrization is convex and can be tested using recently developed methods for the optimization of positive polynomials such as Sum-of-Squares~ \cite{prajna2001introducing}. Some illustrative examples are also included. The results in this paper fall short of the ideal solution in that they rely on the Luenberger observer for state estimation - meaning the closed loop system may be suboptimal. In addition, the results in this paper cannot be directly applied to vector-valued PDE systems.

\subsection{Sum-of-Squares Polynomials (SOSPs)}\label{SOS_sec}

Sum-of-Squares (SOS) is an approach to  the optimization of positive polynomial variables. A typical formalism for the polynomial optimization problem is given by

for all , where the  are real polynomial functions. The key difficulty is that the feasibility problem of determining whether a polynomial is globally positive ( for all ) is NP-hard~\cite{blum1998complexity}. To overcome this difficulty, there are a number of sufficient conditions for polynomial positivity. A particularly important such condition is that the polynomial, , be a Sum-of-Squares,

where the  are polynomials and which is denoted . The importance of the SOS condition lies in the fact that it can be readily enforced using semidefinite programming. This is due to the easily proven fact that for a polynomial  of degree ,  if and only if  for some , where  is the vector of monomials of degree  or less. In this way, optimization of positive polynomials can be converted to semidefinite programming.
The semidefinite-programming approach to polynomial positivity was described in the thesis work of~\cite{parrilo2000structured} and also in~\cite{powers1998algorithm}. See also~\cite{chesi1999convexification} and~\cite{lasserre2001global} for contemporaneous work. MATLAB toolboxes for manipulation of SOS variables have been developed and can be found in~\cite{prajna2001introducing} and~\cite{henrion2003gloptipoly}.

SOS can also be used to optimize polynomials which are positive on a subset of  via Positivstellensatz (PS) results~\cite{stengle1974nullstellensatz,
schmudgen1991thek,putinar1993positive,jacobi2001representation}. To see this, consider a semialgebraic set

for polynomials . A simplified form of PS result can be derived from~\cite{putinar1993positive} and summarized as follows.
\begin{theorem}
For given polynomials , suppose that  is defined as per Equation~\eqref{eqn:semialgebraic_set}. Further suppose that  is compact for some . If the polynomial  satisfies  for , then there exist Sum-of-Squares polynomials  such that

\end{theorem}
As an illustration of this result, suppose we can find Sums-of-Squares polynomials  and , such that . Then  for . The PS tells us that if  is strictly positive ( for ), then such polynomials  and  will always exist. A summary of PS results can be found in~\cite{scheiderer2009positivity}.


\section{A Framework for Analysis and Synthesis of PDEs}


The goal of this paper is to create a practical framework for controller synthesis akin to the LMI framework for ordinary differential equations. To motivate this approach, we recall some notation from the well-developed field of Semigroup theory discussed in the introduction. Within the semigroup framework are certain classes of systems which admit a continuously parameterized operator  which represents the solution map so that any solution  satisfies . Associated with such systems is a possibly unbounded operator  known as the infinitesimal generator which satisfies  for any  where  and  are Hilbert spaces which depend on the system.

Although we do not explicitly use semigroup theory in this paper, it provides a convenient shorthand for presenting and interpreting our results. Specifically, for PDEs in the form of Equation~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form}, we define the first-order differential form

where the operator  is defined as
 and the space  has been defined in Equation~\eqref{state_space_stab}.
Moreover, analogous to the examples in \cite{van1993h} and \cite{byrnes1999example}, it can be established that
 where  is the Dirac delta functional centered at . It can be established that the operator , with domain , generates a strongly continuous semigroup  on  \cite{curtain1995introduction}. Let  with the norm , , where  is the resolvent set of . Additionally, let  be the completion of  with respect to the norm . Then, it has been shown in \cite{harkort2011discrete}, using the results presented in \cite{nagel2000one} and \cite{weiss1989representation}, that  and , the dual space of . Additionally, it has been shown that Equation~\eqref{eqn:firstorderform} has a continuous state strong solution  for any , for all .  

One of the advantages of the operator framework associated with the Semigroup approach is a simplified treatment of Lyapunov functions. Specifically, it is known~\cite{curtain1995introduction} that the strongly continuous semigroup  generated by  is exponentially stable if and only if there exists a positive operator  such that


We refer to the feasibility of Condition~\eqref{eqn:lyapunov_LOI} as a \emph{Linear Operator Inequality} (LOI). This condition in particular is equivalent to the existence of a decreasing Lyapunov function of the form . Of course, there have been many Lyapunov stability tests proposed in the literature for analysis of infinite-dimensional systems. The goal of this paper, however, is to extend these results to controller and observer synthesis.

Roughly speaking, the approach we take in this paper is to formulate linear operator inequalities similar to Condition~\eqref{eqn:lyapunov_LOI} and interpret these inequalities using Lyapunov functions of the form  where the operator  is parameterized using polynomials. Positivity is enforced using Sum-of-Squares and the results in~\cite{peetlmi}. The sections in this paper are defined by the particular form of LOI problem which we hope to solve. Specifically, we have the following problems.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Stability

\item Controller Synthesis

\item Observer Synthesis

\end{enumerate} for .
In the inequalities above, ,  and  are as defined previously.
Furthermore, we parameterize the operators ,  and  as follows.

where  and  are polynomial matrices and .

The operator  is parameterized using   and  polynomial  as



The operator  is parameterized using polynomial  as

\section{Positive operators and semi-separable polynomial kernels}\label{subsec:positivity}

In this paper, our results are expressed as optimization over a set of positive operators. To solve these optimization problems, we use positive matrices to parameterize a subset of positive operators on  as described in~\cite{peetlmi}. We consider operators of the form

where  and  are polynomial matrices and .  In~\cite{peet2008using}, we gave necessary and sufficient conditions for positivity of multiplier and integral operators of similar form using pointwise constraints on the functions ,  and . Recently, in~\cite{peetlmi}, these conditions was sharpened - See Theorem~\ref{thm:jointpos}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:jointpos}
Given  and , , let  and .
Suppose there exists a matrix  such that
 where the  are a partition of . Let

and


Then the operator , defined by Equation~\eqref{eqn:Poperator} is  self-adjoint and satisfies



\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
See~\cite{peetlmi} for a proof.
\end{proof}

For convenience, we define the set of multipliers and kernels which satisfy Theorem~\ref{thm:jointpos}.


\section{Inverses of Positive Operators}

As is the case for the finite-dimensional equivalents of Operator Inequalities~\eqref{eqn:LOI_control} and~\eqref{eqn:LOI_observer}, reconstruction of the controller () and observer () from a feasible solution of the LOI requires inversion of the operator  as  and . Thus, if we are to use the parametrization of positive operators described in Section~\ref{subsec:positivity}, then given such a positive operator, we must have a reliable way of finding its inverse. For operators without joint positivity, this procedure has been presented in~\cite{peet2009inverses} and expanded in~\cite{peet2013inverses}. In this subsection, we further expand these results by proposing a numerical method for constructing inverses for the class of operators considered in Subsection~\ref{subsec:positivity}.
 Specifically, for scalar valued polynomials ,  and  which satisfy the conditions of Theorem~\ref{thm:jointpos}, we will provide a method to construct .

Naturally, all positive operators in the sense of Theorem~\ref{thm:jointpos} are invertible. Our approach is to use a power series expansion with terms which are readily constructed from the matrices described in Theorem~\ref{thm:jointpos}. A closely related result for operators which consist of the identity plus a Volterra operator can be found in \cite[Sec 1.99]{shilov1974elementary}. Our case is slightly different in that we have a positive multiplier  and the Volterra operator is combined with its transpose. Note that the conditions of this theorem are very conservative. In our experience, the series converges whenever  is positive.


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:inv_op}
Suppose  for some  and . Additionally assume that
 Then for the operator  defined as , where
 the inverse is given by
 where

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We begin by noting that since ,  for all . Thus

Consequently,
 is well defined. The small-gain theorem states that  if  then  exists, is bounded and is given by the convergent series

First we examine .

Now, looking at ,

By hypothesis we have that  and  and from the triangle, submultiplicative and Holder inequalities we have
 Thus from \eqref{eqn:inv_op_1} and \eqref{eqn:inv_op_2},
 Hence , which implies

\end{proof}

For convenience, we define the set of multipliers and kernels which satisfy the conditions of both Theorem~\ref{thm:jointpos} and Theorem~\ref{thm:inv_op}.


To construct the inverse, then, we use the MuPAD symbolic engine of MATLAB to evaluate the series  for some finite  where  is chosen sufficiently large so that the series adequately approximates the inverse. In practice, we have found that only a few terms are required for convergence. To illustrate, in Figures~\ref{fig:opinverse1} and \ref{fig:opinverse2} we find some  and find 
for several values of . Then we plot  and  as a function of  for the arbitrarily chose function . In this case,  yields norm error of order .

\section{Stability Analysis}\label{sec:stability}

In this section, we address the simpler problem of stability of PDE systems of the Form~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form}. Roughly speaking, we are looking for a positive operator in the form of Equation~\eqref{eqn:Poperator} which satisfies the inequality

for all  where the operator  is defined in Equation~\eqref{eqn:Aoperator}. The main result relies primarily on the following upper-bound - the proof of which is included in the appendix.

where we define the operator  as

where  and where the linear operator  is defined as follows.
\begin{definition}\label{def:stab_map}
We say  if the following hold
 where .
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:stability}
Suppose that there exist  and  such that

where . Then, for any initial condition , the solution  of Equations~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form}-\eqref{eqn:PDE_form_BC} with  satisfies

where

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 Consider the following Lyapunov function .
 Taking the derivative along trajectories of the system, we have
  Since the initial condition ,  exists for all . For  as defined in~\eqref{eqn:Poperator} and  as defined in Definition~\ref{def:stab_map}, it is shown in the Appendix that if , then
 Now, by definition,  and since by assumption , we have . Moreover, since  and , we have

Since

we have that

Hence we conclude that

Integrating in time yields  and since, , we have
 
 which implies
 
 \end{proof}

 \subsection{Stability Analysis Numerical Results}\label{stabannum}

\paragraph*{Example 1} To illustrate the accuracy of the stability test, we perform several numerical experiments. For the first test, we check the conditions of Theorem~\ref{thm:stability} on a system whose stability properties are known a priori - . The system is defined by Equations~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form} -~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form_BC} with , ,  and , where . The analytic solution to this PDE is given by
 where ,  and  is the initial condition. Thus, one can see that the boundary-value problem is stable for .

 Table~\ref{table_analysis} presents the accuracy of Theorem~\ref{thm:stability} when applied to the problem of determination of the maximum stable . Note that an increase in the degree of polynomials  increases the accuracy of the test in terms of the maximum detectable stable value of . For degree , we can construct a Lyapunov function which proves stability for , with , which is  of the stability margin .

\paragraph*{Example 2} For the second numerical test, we consider a completely arbitrary system defined by Equations~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form} -~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form_BC} with , ,  and . Again, we seek to determine the maximum value of  for which the system is exponentially stable. The maximum stable  predicted by Theorem~\ref{thm:stability} is shown in Table~\ref{table_analysis_1} for . For this system, there is no analytic solution and hence if we wish to determine the accuracy of our results, we must use finite difference methods to simulate the system and hence estimate the true maximum stable value of . This work is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:num_stability}, which suggests that the system is unstable for .

\end{figure}
Finally, although the Lyapunov function generated for this system is too complicated for print, Figure~\ref{fig:V_analysis} illustrates the evolution of this Lyapunov functional time derivative.

\paragraph*{Example 3} In this numerical example we wish to examine if we achieve any performance improvement in the stability analysis by including the integral kernels  and  in the Lyapunov functional operator . Thus, we apply Theorem~\ref{thm:stability}, with , on the systems considered in Examples 1 and 2. Table~\ref{table_comparison_analysis} presents the results.

\label{table_comparison_analysis}
\end{table}
 Comparing Table~\ref{table_comparison_analysis} to Tables~\ref{table_analysis} and \ref{table_analysis_1} shows that for the system considered in Example 1, the integral kernels  and  do not have an effect. However, the inclusion of  and  increases the precision in predicting the stability margin for the system considered in Example 2. Thus, this numerical experiment indicates that for systems with distributed coefficients, including  and  produces sharper results for stability analysis.

\paragraph*{Example 4} For the final numerical test, we wish to examine the effectiveness of the presented method on a system with different boundary conditions. In particular, we consider  with Dirichlet boundary conditions . The analytic solution of this PDE can be calculated as
 where ,  and  is the initial condition. Thus, the system is stable for . The conditions of Theorem~\ref{thm:stability} can be easily modified to analyze this system.

\section{State-Feedback Controller Synthesis}\label{sec:synthesis}


In this section, we use a dual version of the stability condition in Theorem~\ref{thm:stability} to synthesize full-state feedback controllers. Roughly speaking, the dual stability condition is expressed as the search for a positive operator, , of the form of Equation~\eqref{eqn:Poperator} which satisfies the inequality

When we include an input of the form , this becomes

where . Recall the dynamics in Equation~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form}:
 with

with initial condition .
As before our main result uses an upper-bound of the form

where the operator  is defined as

where  and where the linear operator  is defined as follows.
\begin{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Dual Stability]\label{thm:dualstability}
Suppose there exist   and  such that
 
where
.

Then any solution  of~\eqref{eqn:PDE_cont_form} -~\eqref{eqn:PDE_cont_form_BC} with  and  satisfies

where
 
 \end{theorem}
The proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:dualstability} will be implied by the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:synthesis}.

\begin{theorem}[Controller Synthesis]\label{thm:synthesis}
For , , suppose there exist  such that

 \end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Consider the following Lyapunov function . Taking the time derivative along trajectories of the system, we have
 where we have used the fact that  implies .
Now let . Then  and


From Corollary~\ref{cor:dual2}, we have


Since , we have

Thus boundary condition  and the hypothesis  imply


Similarly,  implies



Combining this with , we obtain



Substituting~\eqref{eqn:synth_left_cond} and~\eqref{eqn:synth_right_cond} into~\eqref{eqn:synth_thm_1} and using the definitions of  and  produces

 where we have used the fact that  and  cancel the boundary terms  and .
From the Theorem hypotheses,

Thus we conclude that

Integrating in time yields


Since ,  and thus


Hence,

Which concludes the proof.

\paragraph*{Example 5} In this example, we apply Theorem~\ref{thm:synthesis} to Example 2 from the section on stability analysis. Specifically, System~\eqref{eqn:PDE_cont_form} -~\eqref{eqn:PDE_cont_form_BC} with  and  and . Table \ref{table_synthesis_1} presents the maximum  , for which a controller can be constructed, as a function of degree .

\end{table}The maximum  for which we can construct an exponentially stabilizing controller for is , which is  increase over the stability margin of  which was predicted using finite-difference methods in the previous section. A static controller of the form , , can also be devised using Sturm-Liouville theory \cite[Chapter~5]{egorov1996spectral}. Such a static controller can stabilize the system for . The presented methodology can stabilize the system for , which is an increase of  over . 


Figure \ref{fig:control_control} illustrates the state evolution of the controlled system for ,  and  and the required control effort. Finally, Figure \ref{fig:V_control} illustrates the Lyapunov functional and its time derivative for the controlled system. The initial condition is chosen arbitrarily as

\paragraph*{Example 6} In this example, we apply Theorem~\ref{thm:synthesis} to System~\eqref{eqn:PDE_cont_form} -~\eqref{eqn:PDE_cont_form_BC} with  and  and . These values render the system unstable as verified by numerical simulation in Figure \ref{fig:control_auto}.

We wish to find the maximum exponential decay rate  for which we can construct a controller. Table \ref{table_synthesis_2} presents the results. 
\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Maximum decay rate  under feedback as a function of polynomial degree,  for Example 5 with .}

\end{table}
As we see, the maximum  for which we can construct an exponentially stabilizing controller is . This is an increase of  over  for which an exponentially stabilizing controller can be constructed using Sturm-Liouville theory.

\paragraph*{Example 7} The presence of the integral kernels  and  in the Lyapunov functional operator  necessitates the inclusion of  in the control operator . As a result, if we wish to use this controller with only an output, instead of the complete state, available for design, an observer is required to be constructed. Thus, it is important to establish the performance improvement gained by the inclusion of ,  and . For this purpose, we compare the results obtained in Example 5 to the results obtained for a simple static output feedback based controller which is achieved by setting  and . We apply Theorem~\ref{thm:synthesis}, for  and , on the System considered in Example 5, that is, with  and  and . Table \ref{table_synthesis_3} presents the maximum  , for which a static controller can be constructed, as a function of degree .

\end{table} Upon comparing these results with the ones presented in Table~\ref{table_synthesis_1}, it is evident that the inclusion of ,  and  produces much sharper results.



\section{Observer Synthesis}\label{obsynth}
Recall the dynamics of System~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form}:

with output . Because of the infinite-dimensional nature of PDEs of the Form~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form}, real-time measurement of the state is not possible. For this reason, any realistic approach to control must include an observer and must account for the error dynamics in the closed-loop response. The simplest form of observer for which it is possible to verify closed-loop stability is the Luenberger observer. In our version of the Luenberger observer, the dynamics of the state estimate,  are defined by operator  and  as

where  with boundary conditions
 
where recall that in feedback  and hence the state itself satisfies

with output  and boundary conditions 

A block-diagram of the coupled dynamics can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:schema}.

For the coupled dynamics, we consider the following coupled initial conditions

where we assume the initial conditions are consistent with the equations as .


In finite-dimensional systems, the Luenberger observer has the property that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system is the union of the eigenvalues of  and the eigenvalues of . This implies that stability in closed-loop is equivalent to stability of these two subsystems.

In the following theorem, we prove the analogue of this result for System~\eqref{eqn:PDE_form} in feedback using the Luenberger observer. Our conditions have the form of the following Linear Operator Inequality.


\begin{theorem}\label{observer_synth_colloc}
Suppose there exist
 and ,
such that

where


Let
 
where
 and

Then, for initial conditions  and  given in \eqref{eqn:obs_init_1}-\eqref{eqn:obs_init_2}, there exists a constant  such that any solution  of~\eqref{eqn:obs_coupled_1}-\eqref{eqn:obs_coupled_BC_2} satisfies


\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We begin by defining the state estimation error , the dynamics of which are given by
  with boundary conditions

For the error system, we define the following Lyapunov functional

Taking the time derivative yields
 
Let  then  implies , and hence Corollary~\ref{cor:primal2} and  imply
 
 where

Now,
 
and   implies

  Substituting Equation~\eqref{eqn:Vdot_obs_inter} into \eqref{eqn:Vdot_obs1}, yields
 where, the boundary terms have been canceled due to  and .

Since we have

we conclude that

Since , we have
 
Now, since the state satisfies

with   and  then by applying  to Theorem~\ref{thm:synthesis}, we conclude exponential stability of the coupled system. which implies the existence of an  such that

\end{proof}
 Note that in this theorem we have chosen a common positivity margin  and exponential decay rate  for the controller and observer synthesis conditions. In practice, it is customary to choose a faster decay rate for the observer than the controller. In this case, the conditions should be modified accordingly.

\subsection{Observer Synthesis Numerical Results}

\section{Conclusion}

 In this paper, we have developed a algorithmic approach to the design of observer-based controllers for a general class of scalar parabolic partial differential equations using point measurements and feedback at the boundary. The results use the sum-of-squares methodology to parameterize a convex set of positive operators. In this way we cast the problem of controller synthesis in the framework of convex optimization - a class of optimization problems for which we have efficient numerical algorithms. Furthermore, we have applied our results to a difficult numerical example in order to demonstrate that our results are practical and effective. The reader is invited to contemplate natural extensions of this work including the development of methods for control of coupled partial-differential equations. We also speculate that the conditions as stated are conservative and may be improved through a generalization of the Wirtinger inequality, or some other method for relating state parameters , etc. Additional possibilities include application to other classes of PDE system.



\appendix\label{sec:appendix}
First, recall the variation  of Wirtinger's Inequality.

 where .
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:primal}

for any  where  is defined in Equation~\eqref{state_space_stab} and where  is defined as

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We begin by considering the following decomposition

We conclude that
 
Through integration by parts and application of boundary conditions, we also obtain
 
Now, note that for , we have . Exploiting this property, we find 
 We can re-write the previous expression as
  Changing the order of integration in the last two double integrals and switching the variables  and ,
 
 
 Similarly,
  
Finally, employing a change of order of integration produces
 
 Substituting \eqref{Gamma_1}-\eqref{Gamma_5} into \eqref{Gamma_eqn} gives us
  Since , . This gives us the desired result.
 \end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:primal2}
Suppose we are given   and . Then, for  as defined in Equation~\eqref{eqn:Aoperator} and  as defined in Equation~\eqref{eqn:Poperator}, we have that
 
for any  with  where  is defined as

\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Omit the last line in the proof of Lemma~\ref{cor:primal2}.
\end{proof}

The following lemma gives a result which is dual to Lemma~\ref{lem:dual}.

\begin{definition}
We say  if the following hold

\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:dual}
Suppose  and . Then, for  as defined in Equation~\eqref{eqn:Aoperator} and  as defined in Equation~\eqref{eqn:Poperator}, we have that

for any  where  is defined in Equation~\eqref{state_space_stab} and

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We begin by considering the following decomposition
 where
 and


Applying integration by parts,
 Since , applying Lemma~\ref{lem:wirtinger} yields
 Thus


Similarly


Applying integration by parts and using the fact that , we get
 Using a change of order of integration as applied in Equation~\eqref{Gamma_3} in Lemma~\ref{lem:primal}, we obtain
 Similarly,
 and


Substituting \eqref{eqn:dual_gamma_1}-\eqref{eqn:dual_gamma_5} in \eqref{eqn:dual_gamma},


Since , there exists a  such that  which implies . Hence, we obtain the boundary condition

Since ,  and hence

Substituting this boundary condition into the last term of \eqref{eqn:dual_setup} gives us the desired result.
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}\label{cor:dual2}
Suppose we are given   and . Then, for  as defined in Equation~\eqref{eqn:Aoperator} and  as defined in Equation~\eqref{eqn:Poperator}, we have that

for any  where  is defined in Equation~\eqref{state_space_stab} and

\end{corollary}
The proof of Corollary~\ref{cor:dual2} is implied by the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:dual} in Inequality~\eqref{eqn:proof_ineq}.
