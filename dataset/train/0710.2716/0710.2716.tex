problem of pinning control for synchronization of complex dynamical

\section{Introduction and problem formulation}
\quad Complex networks are currently being studied across many
fields of sciences, including physics, chemistry, biology,
mathematics, sociology and engineering
\cite{r2,r12,r3,r5,r4,r11,r6,r1}. A complex network is a large set
of interconnected nodes, in which a node is a fundamental unit with
specific contents. Examples of complex networks include the
Internet, food webs, cellular neural networks, biological neural
networks, electrical power grids, telephone cell graphs, etc.
Recently, synchronization of complex networks of dynamical systems
has received a great deal of attention from the nonlinear dynamics
community \cite{jia54,r7,jia51,jia52,jia56}. A special control
strategy called \textit{pinning control} is used to achieve
synchronization of complex networks; that is, only a fraction of the
nodes or even a single node is controlled over the whole network
\cite{jia53,r8,jia55,jia57}. This control method has become a common
technique for control, stabilization and synchronization of coupled
dynamical systems. In general, different nodes have different
degrees in a network, thus a natural question is how different the
effect would be when nodes with different degrees are pinned.

Consider a dynamical network consisting of N identical and
diffusively coupled nodes, with each node being an -dimensional
dynamical system. The state equations of the network are

where  is the dynamical function of an isolated node,
 are the state variables
of node , constant  represents the coupling strength, and
 is the inner linking matrix. Moreover, the
coupling matrix  represents the
coupling configuration of the network: If there is a connection
between node  and node  , then ;
otherwise,  ; the diagonal entries of
 are defined by

Suppose that the network is connected in the sense of having no
isolated clusters. Then, the coupling matrix  is irreducible.
From Lemma 2 of \cite{jia56}, it can be proved that zero is an
eigenvalue of  with multiplicity one and all the other
eigenvalues of  are strictly negative.

Network (\ref{syn1}) is said to achieve (asymptotical)
synchronization if

where, because of the diffusive coupling configuration,  is a
solution of an isolated node, which can be an equilibrium, a
periodic or a chaotic orbit. As shown in
\cite{jia53,r8,jia55,jia57}, this can be achieved by controlling
several nodes (or even only one node) of the network. Without loss
of generality, suppose that the controllers are added on the last
 nodes of the network, so that the equations of the controlled
network can be written as

where the feedback gains  are positive constants. It
can be seen that synchronizing all states  to  is
determined by the dynamics of an isolated node, the coupling
strength , the inner linking matrix , the feedback
gains , and the coupling matrix .

As discussed in \cite{r8,jia55,jia57}, to achieve synchronization of
complex dynamical networks, the controllers are generally preferred
to be added to the nodes with larger degrees. However, it is also
known that, to achieve a certain synchronizability of the network,
the feedback gains  usually have to be quite large.
In \cite{jia53}, when a single controller is used, the coupling
strength  has to be quite large in general. From the view point
of realistic applications, these are not expected and sometimes
cannot be realized. Practically, a designed control strategy is
expected to be effective and also easily implementable. In this
paper, for various star-shaped networks and non-regular complex
networks, a new concept of cost function is introduced to evaluate
the efficiency of the designed controllers. It is found that
surprisingly the cost can be much lower by controlling nodes with
smaller degrees than controlling nodes with larger degrees. As will
be seen, moreover, both the feedback gains  and the
coupling strength  can be much smaller than those used in
\cite{jia53,r8,jia55,jia57}.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, a new
definition of cost function and some mathematical preliminaries are
given. Stability of different star-shaped networks controlled by
pinning some nodes with small degrees are analyzed in Sections 3 and
4, respectively, where some simulated examples of dynamical networks
are compared for illustration and verification. In Section 5,
pinning control of non-regular complex dynamical networks of chaotic
oscillators is studied through numerical simulations. Finally,
Section 6 concludes the paper.

\section{The cost of pinning control}

\quad Denote , where  satisfies . Then, the error equations of network \dref{syn1} can
be written as

while the error equations of the controlled network \dref{cost7} can
be written as

where

and  otherwise. Let
, and denote

Differentiating \dref{syn5} along  gives

By analyzing the matrix , it is easy to see that all
the eigenvalues of  are negative, which are denoted by

There exists an orthogonal matrix  such that
, where
. Let
. Then, from \dref{syn6}, one has

Therefore, the local stability problem of network \dref{cost7} is
converted into the stability problem of the  independent linear
systems \dref{syn7}. When the system function of an isolated node
and the inner linking matrix  are fixed, the stability
problem of systems \dref{syn7} are dependent on the coupling
strength  and the eigenvalues of . Clearly, the
smaller the eigenvalues of the matrix  are
(), the smaller the coupling strength
 is needed to guarantee the same synchronizability of the
network \dref{cost7}, if systems \dref{syn7} have unbounded
synchronization regions \cite{jia52}. In the following, a cost
function is introduced to describe the efficiency of the
controllers.

\textbf {Definition 1} (Cost Function) Suppose that the feedback
gain matrix is  ,

\dref{cost7}. The Cost Function is defined as


\textbf {Remark 1} The smaller the , the more efficient a
control strategy to achieve the same goal of control, and the easier
to be implemented.

In order to discuss the effects of pinning control, the following
Lemmas are needed.

Hermitian, and let  be a
rearrangement of its diagonal entries in increasing order. Let the
eigenvalues of  be ordered as

Then


\textbf {Remark 2} For diffusive networks, the smaller the

unbound synchronized region \cite{jia52}. However, Lemma 2 shows
that  is related to , where  and
 are determined by two smallest nodes. Therefore, in this
case, in order to improve the synchronizability, these small nodes
should be pinned.

\textbf {Lemma 3} Let  be Hermitian, and

\section{Simple star-shaped networks}

\quad Now, consider a network consisting of  identical nodes with
a simple star-shaped coupling configuration: there exists a central
node which connects to all the other non-central nodes, and there
are no direct connections among the non-central nodes. Fig. 1 gives
an example of such a network.

The coupling matrix  of network \dref{syn1} with a simple
star-shaped coupling configuration can been written as

Let the feedback gain matrix be  that

simplicity in this discussion. Then, the coupling matrix of the
controlled network \dref{cost7} is

From the Schur complement Lemma, , which leads
to the assertion of the theorem. \hfill 

\textbf {Remark 4} Theorem 1 shows that under the control strategy
of adding controllers to all the non-central nodes, as the constant
 increases, the eigenvalues of the matrix 
will approach . Further, suppose that  and take
. Then, based on Theorem 1, to guarantee that
, the feedback
 gain  only needs to satisfy

In this case, if the coupling strength of network \dref{syn4} is
, then the cost function is . From
\dref{cost2} and through direct calculations, it is easy to see that
under the control strategy of adding controllers to the non-central
nodes,  suffices to guarantee that
.

\textbf {Remark 5} Consider the control strategy that a single
controller is added to the central node. In this case, the feedback
gain matrix is given by  and . Let 
represent the largest eigenvalue of matrix . Then, based
on Lemma 2,  no matter how large the
, or equally the cost function , is taken. This
shows that in order to guarantee  be small, the small
nodes should be pinned.

Some simulations on the network \dref{syn4}, shown in Fig. 1, are
presented in Figs. 23, where the dynamics of an isolated node
is a chaotic oscillator \cite{r9}, , and
the synchronized state is set to be ,
which is an unstable equilibrium point of an isolated node
\cite{r10}.

From Figs. 23, it can be seen that even with both a small
coupling strength  and a small cost function , the
synchronization of network \dref{syn4} can be faster to achieve when
the controllers are added to all the non-central nodes (nodes with
smaller degrees) than the case that a single controller is added to
the central node (the node with a larger degree). Although the more
controllers are needed for pinning nodes with smaller degrees, the
total cost is still lower and the control effect is better in
comparison.


\section{Clusters of star-shaped networks with global coupling}

\quad Consider a network consisting of  identical nodes in
clusters of star-shaped coupling configuration: there are 
central nodes which are connected to each other; each central node
may have different numbers of non-central nodes attached to it;
there are no direct connections among the non-central nodes; and any
central node has no direct connection to a non-central node attached
to another central node. Fig. 4 gives an example of such a network
for the case of .

inner liking matrix , and the synchronized state are the
same as that given in Section 2.

From Fig. 5, it can be seen that although all the non-central nodes
are pinned, the cost is lower and the effect is better than the case
where the central nodes are pinned.

\section{Some non-regular complex networks}

\quad In this section, first, a non-regular coupled network
consisting of 20 nodes is generated following the procedure of the
well-known BA model. Fig. 6 shows the synchronization of the network
with controllers being added to the three ``biggest" nodes of
degrees 15, 13 and 10, respectively. The dynamics of an isolated
node, the inner liking matrix , and the synchronized state
are the same as that given in Section 2. From Figs. 6(c) and 6(d),
it can be seen that the network does not synchronize any faster,
although a larger feedback gain is used. In Fig. 7, a different
control scheme is applied: eleven nodes with smaller degrees in the
network are pinned with coupling strength  and feedback gain
, yielding cost function . Compared with Fig.
6, a better control performance is obtained with a much smaller cost
function. Figs. 8 and 9 also show that it is more efficient by
pinning nodes with smaller degrees than pinning nodes with larger
degrees. As shown in Fig. 8, to achieve a similar synchronization
effect, a much smaller feedback gain is needed in pinning ``smaller"
nodes than pinning ``larger" ones, thereby the cost function is also
smaller in the former control scheme than that in the latter. Fig. 9
shows that although the coupling strength, the feedback gain and the
cost function are similar, the synchronization effect is better in
pinning ``smaller" nodes than pinning ``larger" ones.

It seems more efficient to use the control scheme of pinning nodes
with smaller degrees than pinning nodes with larger degrees for
achieving the desired synchronous states of some non-regular coupled
dynamical networks. This is an interesting phenomenon that was not
noticed before.

\section{Conclusions}

\quad In this paper, pinning control to achieve synchronization of
complex dynamical networks is further investigated. In contrary to
the general perception, the nodes with smaller degrees play an
important role in the synchronizability of some networks. It has
been shown by computer simulations in this paper that to achieve a
similar synchronization effect on the networks considered, a smaller
coupling strength, a smaller feedback gain and thus a lower cost
function are needed in the control scheme of pinning nodes with
smaller degrees comparing with those needed in pinning nodes with
larger degrees. In other words, it seems more efficient to use the
control scheme of pinning nodes with smaller degrees than that of
pinning nodes with larger degrees for some dynamical networks to
achieve synchronization, an interesting phenomenon that deserves
further investigation in the future.
