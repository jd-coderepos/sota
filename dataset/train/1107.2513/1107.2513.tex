\begin{abstract}
Dialectica categories are a very versatile categorical model of linear logic. 
These have been used to model many seemingly different things (e.g.,
Petri nets and Lambek's calculus). In this note, we expand our previous
work on fuzzy petri nets to deal with fuzzy topological systems. One basic idea is 
to use as the dualizing object in the Dialectica categories construction, 
the unit real interval ,  which has all the properties of a 
{\em lineale}. The second basic idea is to generalize Vickers's notion of a 
topological system.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic have been invented by Lotfi ali Asker Zadeh. 
This is a theory that started from a generalization of the set concept and the 
notion of a truth value (for an overview, for example, see~\cite{klir95}). In fuzzy 
set theory, an element of a fuzzy subset belongs to it to a degree, which is usually 
a number between  and . For example, if we have a fuzzy subset of white colors, 
then all the gray-scale colors are white to a certain degree and, thus, belong to t
his set with a degree. The following definition by Zadeh himself explains what  fuzzy logic 
is:\footnote{The definition was posted to the bisc-group mailing list on 22/11/2008.}        
\begin{definition}
Fuzzy logic is a precise system of reasoning, deduction and computation in which 
the objects of discourse and analysis are associated with information which is, or 
is allowed to be, imprecise, uncertain, incomplete, unreliable, partially true or 
partially possible. 
\end{definition}

Categories, which were invented by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane, form a very 
high-level abstract mathematical theory that unifies all branches of mathematics.
Category theory plays a central role in modern mathematics and 
theoretical computer science, and, in addition,  it is used in mathematical 
physics, in  software engineering, etc. Categories have been used to model and
study logical systems. In particular, the Dialectica categories of de Paiva~\cite{paiva89} 
are categorical model of linear logic~\cite{girard95}. These categories have been used
to model Petri nets~\cite{brown90}, the Lambek Calculus~\cite{paiva90}, 
state in programming~\cite{correaetal96}, and to define fuzzy petri 
nets~\cite{paivasyropoulos11}. Using some of the ideas in our previous work on 
fuzzy petri nets, we wanted to develop the idea of fuzzy topological systems, that is, 
the fuzzy counterpart of Vickers's~\cite{vickers90} topological systems. In this note, 
we present fuzzy topological systems and discuss some of their properties. 

\section{The category }\label{basic:notions}
The Dialectica categories construction (see for example~\cite{paiva06}) can be  
instantiated using any lineale  and the basic category .  As discussed 
in~\cite{syropoulos06}, the unit interval, since it is a Heyting algebra, has all the 
properties of a lineale structure. Recall that a lineale is a structure defined as follows:
\begin{definition}
The quintuple  is a lineale if:
\begin{itemize}
\item  is poset,
\item  is an order-preserving multiplication,
      such that  is a symmetric monoidal structure (i.e.,
      for all , ).
\item if for any  exists a largest  such that 
      , then this element is denoted  and
      is called the pseudo-complement of  with respect to .
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Now, one can prove that the quintuple 
, where  is the unit interval, 
, and   
(),  is a lineale.

Let  and  be nonempty sets. A binary fuzzy relation  in  and  is a 
fuzzy subset of , or . The value of  
is interpreted as the {\em degree} of membership of the ordered pair  in . 
Let us now define a category of fuzzy relations.
 
\begin{definition}
The category  has  as objects triples 
, where  and  are sets and  is a map 
. Thus, each object is  a fuzzy relation.  A map from 
 to   is a pair of   maps ,  
,  such that

or in pictorial form:
\begin{diagram}
U\times Y                         & \rTo^{\mathrm{id}_{U}\times g}     & U\times X\\
\dTo^{f\times\mathrm{id}_{Y}}     & \ge                                & \dTo_{\alpha}\\
V\times Y                         & \rTo_{\beta}                       & \mathrm{I}
\end{diagram}
\end{definition}

Assume that  and  are the following arrows:

Then  such that


Tensor products  and the internal-hom in  are given as  in the Girard-variant of the  Dialectica construction~\cite{paiva89}.
Given objects  and  , the tensor product   is
, where the  is the relation that, using the lineale structure of , takes the minimum of the membership degrees. The linear function-space or internal-hom is 
given by , where again the relation  is given by the implication in the lineale. With this structure we obtain:
\begin{theorem}
The category  is a  monoidal closed category with products and coproducts.
\end{theorem}
Products and coproducts are given by  and 
, where 
 is the 
fuzzy relation that is defined as follows

Similarly for the coproduct .

\section{Fuzzy Topological Systems}
Let  be an object of , 
where  is a frame, that is, a poset  where
\begin{enumerate}
\item every subset  of  has a join
\item every finite subset  of  has a meet
\item binary meets distribute over joins, if  is a subset of :

\end{enumerate}
Given such a triple, we can view  as a {\em fuzzy topological system}, that is, the fuzzy 
counterpart of Vickers's~\cite{vickers90} {\em topological systems}.

A {\em topological system} in Vicker's monograph\cite{vickers90} is a triple
, where  is a frame whose elements are called {\em opens} and 
 is a set whose elements are called {\em points}. Also,  the relation   
is a subset of , and when , we say that  {\em satisfies} 
. In addition, the following must hold
\begin{itemize}
\item if  is a finite subset of , then

\item if  is any subset of , then 

\end{itemize}

Given two topological systems  and , a map from  to  
consists of a  function  and a frame homomorphism ,
if . Topological systems and 
continuous maps between them form a category, which we write as .

In order to fuzzify topological systems, we need to fuzzify the relation ``.''
However, the requirement imposed on the relation of satisfaction is too severe when dealing
with fuzzy structures. Indeed, in some reasonable categorical models of fuzzy structures 
(see, for example~\cite{barr91,syropoulos06}), the authors use a weaker condition where the e
quivalence operator is replaced by an implication operator. Thus we suggest that the corresponding condition for morphisms of  fuzzy topological systems should become 
.   
\begin{definition}
A {\em fuzzy topological system} is a triple , where  is a set,  is a frame
and  a binary fuzzy relation such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] If  is a finite subset of , then

\item[(ii)] If  is any subset of , then 

\item[(iii)]  and  for all .
\end{itemize} 
\end{definition}
To see that fuzzy topological systems also form a category we need to show that given morphisms  and  , the obvious composition   is also a morphism of fuzzy topological systems. But we know  is a category and conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) do not apply to morphisms. Identities are given by .

The collection of objects of  that are fuzzy topological
systems and the arrows between them, form the category , which is a
 subcategory of . 


\begin{proposition}
Any topological system  is a fuzzy topological system , where

\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Consider the first property of the relation ``''

This will be translated to 

The inequality is in fact an equality since whenever , . Therefore,
we can transform this condition into the following one

A similar argument holds true for the second property.
\end{proof}
The following result is based on the previous one: 
\begin{theorem}
The category of topological systems is a full subcategory of 
.
\end{theorem}

Obviously, it is not enough to provide generalization of structures---one needs to
demonstrate that these new structures have some usefulness. The following example
gives an interpretation of these structures in a ``real-life'' situation.
\begin{example}
Vickers~\cite[p.~53]{vickers90} gives an interesting physical interpretation of 
topological systems. In particular, he considers the set  to be a set of programs 
that generate bit streams and the opens to be assertions about bit streams. For exanple, 
if  is a program that generates the infinite bit stream 010101010101\ldots and 
``\textbf{starts} 01010'' is an assertion that is satified if a bit stream starts 
with the digits ``01010'', then this is expressed as follows: 

Assume now that  is a program that produces bit streams that look like the following one
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{fuzzy-bits.pdf}
\end{center}
The individuals bits are not identical to either ``1'' or ``0,'' but rather similar 
to these. One can speculate that these bits are the result of some interaction of 
 with its environment and this is the reason they are not identical. Then, we can 
say that  satisfies the assertion ``\textbf{starts} 01010'' to some degree, since 
the elements that make up the stream produced by  are not identical, but rather similar.
\end{example}
\section{From Fuzzy Topological Systems to Fuzzy Topological Spaces}


It is not difficult to map fuzzy topological systems to fuzzy topological spaces 
(for an overview of the theory of fuzzy topologies see~\cite{ying-ming97}). 
The following definition shows how to map an open to fuzzy set:
\begin{definition}
Assume that , where  is a fuzzy topological space. Then the 
{\em extent} of an open  is a function whose graph is given below:

\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
The collection of all fuzzy sets created by the extents of the members of  
correspond to a fuzzy topology on . 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Assume that  and  are opens and let ,
, and . Then 
 and . In
different words,   and , which implies
that  that is . 
Similarly, assume that  is a collection of opens such that 
and . The fact that there is one ,
while for all other  it holds that , implies that
, that is, . Finally, the
last conditions generate the sets  and . So, the
opens form a fuzzy topology on .
\end{proof}

\section{Products and Sums of Fuzzy Topological Systems}
In section~\ref{basic:notions} we described the categorical products and coproducts
of any two objects of . Given two fuzzy 
topological systems  and , their topological
product is the space . Since  and  are frames
it is necessary to modify the definition of  and, consequently, the definition of
. 
\begin{definition}
Assume that  and  are two fuzzy topological
systems. Then their topological product  is the system
, where  is the tensor product
of the two frames  and  (see~\cite[pp.~80--85]{vickers90} for details)
and  is defined as follows:

\end{definition}
Obviously, the topological product is not the same as the categorical product. 
The topological sum is more straigthtforward:
\begin{definition}
Assume that  and  are two fuzzy topological
systems. Then their topological sum  is the system
, where  is defined as follows:

\end{definition}
Comparing the topological sum with the categorical sum reveals that they are identical.
\section{Conclusions}
We have simply started thinking about the possibilities of using
Dialectica-like models in the context of fuzzy topological
structures. Much remains to be done, in particular we would like to
see if a framework based on an implicational notion of morphism like
ours can cope with embedding several of the other notions of fuzzy
sets considered by Rodabaugh~\cite{rodabaugh1983}. Also seems likely 
that we could extend the work of Solovyov~\cite{solovyov2010} on 
variable-basis topological spaces using similar ideas.
