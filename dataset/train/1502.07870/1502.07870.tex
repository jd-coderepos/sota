\section{Introduction}
\label{sect-intro}
In the extensive literature of stringology/combinatorics on words,
a ``string'' or ``word'' has usually been defined as a sequence
of individual elements of a distinguished set  called an ``alphabet''.
Nevertheless, going back as far as the groundbreaking paper of
Fischer \& Paterson \cite{FP74}, more general sequences,
defined instead on {\it subsets} of , have also been considered.
The more constrained model introduced in \cite{FP74} restricts
entries in a string to be either elements of 
(subsets of size 1) or  itself (subsets of size );
these have been studied in recent years as
``strings with don't cares'' \cite{IMMP03}, also
``strings with holes'' or ``partial words'' \cite{BS08}.
The unconstrained model, which allows arbitrary nonempty subsets of ,
has also attracted significant attention,
often because of applications in bioinformatics:
such strings have variously been called ``generalized'' \cite{A87},
``indeterminate'' \cite{HS03}, or ``degenerate'' \cite{IMR08}.

In this paper we study strings
in their full generality,
hence the following definitions:

\begin{definition}
\label{defn-string}
Suppose a set  of symbols (called the \itbf{alphabet}) is given.
A \itbf{string} \s{x} on  of \itbf{length}  is a sequence
of  nonempty finite subsets of , called \itbf{letters};
we represent \s{x} as an array .
If , \s{x} is called the \itbf{empty string}
and denoted by ;
if for every ,  is a subset of  of size 1,
\s{x} is said to be a \itbf{regular string}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{defn-match}
Suppose we are given two strings \s{x} and \s{y} and integers ,
. We say that  and  \itbf{match}
(written ) if and only if . Then \s{x} and \s{y} \itbf{match} ()
if and only if 
and  for every .
\end{definition}
Note that matching is not necessarily transitive:
, but .

\begin{definition}
\label{defn-prefix}
The \itbf{prefix table} (also \itbf{prefix array})\footnote{
We prefer ``table'' because of the possible confusion with ``suffix array'',
a completely different data structure.}
of a string  is the integer array

such that for every ,  is the
length of the longest prefix of  that matches a prefix of .
Thus for every prefix table , .
When there is no ambiguity, we write .
\end{definition}
The prefix table is an important data structure for strings:
it identifies all the borders, hence all the periods,
of every prefix of \s{x} \cite{CRSW13}.
It was originally introduced to facilitate the computation of
repetitions in regular strings \cite{ML84}, see also \cite{S03};
and for regular strings, prefix table and border array are equivalent,
since each can be computed from the other in linear time \cite{BKS13}.
For general strings, the prefix table can be computed in compressed form in  time
using  bytes of storage space \cite{SW08},
where .
Two examples follow, adapted from \cite{CRSW13}:



Since clearly every position  in a prefix table \s{\pi}
must satisfy , the following definition is a natural one:
\begin{quote}
An array  of integers is said to be a \itbf{feasible array}
if and only if  and for every ,
.
\end{quote}

An immediate consequence of Definition~\ref{defn-prefix} is the following:
\begin{lemma}[\cite{CRSW13}]
\label{lemm-easy}
Let  be a string.
An integer array  is the prefix table
of  if and only if for each position ,
the following two conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] ;
\item[(b)] if , then .
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
Then the following fundamental result establishes the important connection
between strings and feasible arrays:

\begin{lemma}[\cite{CRSW13}]
\label{lemm-feas}
Every feasible array is the prefix table of some string.
\end{lemma}
\ifProofs
 \begin{proof}
 Consider an undirected graph  whose vertex set  is the set of positions  in a given feasible
 array .  The edge set  consists of the 2-element subsets  such that
 
for every .
We then define \s{x} as follows:
for each non-isolated vertex ,
let  be the set of edges incident with ;
for each isolated vertex , let  be the loop .
Let  where  is the set of loops.
We claim that  is the prefix table of .

To see this, note that for an index  such that ,
Lemma \ref{lemm-easy}(a) is satisfied by construction.
Then suppose that for some  and ,
.
But this contradicts Lemma~\ref{lemm-easy}(b),
and so 

In case , Lemma \ref{lemm-easy}(a) is satisfied vacuously.
Moreover,  is isolated and thus ,
which does not match ; consequently,
Lemma  \ref{lemm-easy}(b) is again satisfied.
Therefore, 
 coincides with the prefix table of , which is a string over the set  of subsets of . \qed
\end{proof}
\fi

In view of this lemma, we say that a feasible array
is \itbf{regular} if it is the prefix array of a regular string.
We are now able to state the goal of this paper as follows:
for a given feasible array ,
not necessarily regular,
construct a string \s{x} on a minimum alphabet
whose prefix table  --- the ``reverse engineering''
problem for the prefix table in its full generality.
In fact, we do somewhat more: we construct a
lexicographically least such string,
in a sense to be defined in Section~\ref{sect-prelim}.

The first reverse engineering problem in stringology was stated and solved
in \cite{FLRS99,FGLR02}, where an algorithm was described
to compute a lexicographically least regular string whose border array was
a given integer array --- or to return the result that no such regular string exists.
Many other similar constructions have since been published,
related to other stringological data structures but always specific to
regular strings (see \cite{BIST03,DLL05,FS06,MNRR13}, among others).
\cite{NRR12} was the first paper to consider the more general problem
of inferring an indeterminate string from a given data structure
(specifically, border array, suffix array and LCP array).
Although solving such problems does not yield immediate applications,
nevertheless solutions provide a deeper understanding of the combinatorial many-many relationship between
strings and the various data structures developed from them
(see for example \cite{MSM99},
where canonical strings corresponding to given border arrays are identified
and efficiently generated for use as test data).

For prefix tables and regular strings,
the reverse engineering problem was solved in \cite{CCR09},
where a linear-time algorithm was described to return
a lexicographically least regular string \s{x} whose
prefix table is the given feasible array \s{y}, or an error message if no
such \s{x} exists.
A recent paper \cite{BBD14} sketches two algorithms
to compute an indeterminate string \s{x} on a minimum alphabet
(not necessarily lexicographically least) corresponding to
a given feasible array \s{y},
but the algorithms are theoretical in nature:
one requires the determination of the chromatic number of a certain graph,
an NP-hard problem,
while the other depends on somehow identifying the minimum
``induced positive edge cover'' of a graph.
However, \cite{BBD14} proves an important result that we use
below to bound the complexity of our algorithm:
that the minimum alphabet size  of a string corresponding
to a given feasible array of length  is at most .
In this paper
we use graph-theoretic methods developed from \cite{CRSW13}
to compute a lexicographically least string,
regular or not, corresponding to the given \s{y},
in time .




Section~\ref{sect-prelim} of this paper provides background material
for an understanding of our algorithm;
Section~\ref{sect-alg} presents the algorithm itself;
Section~\ref{sect-future} briefly discusses these results
and suggests future work.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sect-prelim}
Following \cite{CRSW13}, for a given feasible array ,
we define a corresponding graph ,
on which our algorithm will be based:

The following lemma will be useful for the analysis of our algorithm:

\begin{lemma}[\cite{CRSW13}]
\label{lemm-reg}
Let  be a prefix graph of a feasible array
\s{y}. Then \s{y} is regular if and only if every edge of 
joins two vertices in distinct connected components of .
\end{lemma}
\ifProofs
\begin{proof}
[if] Suppose that every negative edge
joins two vertices in distinct connected components of .
Form a regular string  as follows: for each component  of , assign a unique identical letter, say , to all positions  for which .  We show that  is the prefix table of  and therefore that  is regular.  Fix a value .  For any  such that ,  is a positive edge.
 Thus  and  are in the same component of , and hence .  We also note
that  is a negative edge
(provided ).
If so, then by hypothesis  and  lie
in disjoint components of , so that,
by the uniqueness of ,
.
This is precisely what we need in order to conclude
that  is the prefix table of .
Since \s{x} is regular, so is \s{y}, as required. \\

\noindent
[only if]
Suppose that \s{y} is regular,
therefore the prefix table of a regular string .
Now consider any negative edge  of the prefix graph 
of \s{y}, so that by Lemma~\ref{lemm-easy}(b)
.
If  and  were in the same component of ,
we would have by Lemma~\ref{lemm-easy}(a)
a path in  joining
 to  consisting of edges  such that .
By the regularity of \s{y}, this requires ,
so that , a contradiction.  \qed

 \end{proof}
\fi



So as to discuss the lexicographical ordering of strings on an ordered alphabet ,
we need first of all a definition of the order of two letters:
\begin{definition}
\label{letterorder}
Suppose two letters  and  are given, where

with  for every ,
 for every .
We assume without loss of generality that ,
also that  for every  and
 for every .
Then  if and only if
 for every  and ; while
 if and only if
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
 for every ; or
\item[(b)]
 for every  {\bf and}
.
\end{itemize}
Otherwise, .
\end{definition}
Note that ,
but that  implies neither equality nor an ordering
of  and .
We remark also that the definition of letter order given here is
not the only possible or useful one.
For example, it would require
, thus arguably not
placing sufficient emphasis on economy of letter selection in the alphabet.

\begin{definition}
\label{wordorder}
Now suppose that two strings 
and  on  are given,
where without loss of generality we assume that .
Then  if and only if 
for every  and ; while
 if and only if
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
 for every ; or
\item[(b)]
 for every  \bf{and}
.
\end{itemize}
Otherwise, .
\end{definition}

To better illustrate the relation of strings defined and used in this paper
we present the following examples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
  \item 
  \item

\section{Algorithm RevEng}
\label{sect-alg}

\subsection{The Algorithm}
The basic strategy of Algorithm RevEng, that constructs a lexicographically least
string \s{x} (initially empty)
corresponding to a given feasible array , is
expressed by the main steps given below.
Initially the alphabet  is empty (), as are the sets ,
.
\begin{description}
\item[(S1)]
Consider the edges  of  in increasing order of 
in order to add a single letter to , , or both based on the following steps;
\item[(S2)]
if, by virtue of previous assignments, 
(so neither is empty),
there is nothing to do ---  can be skipped;
\item[(S3)]
otherwise, for the current , determine a sequence

of all candidate assignments,
where for every ,  (respectively, )
if  (respectively, ),
and ;
\item[(S4)]
for the current , determine whether or not the assignment

is ``allowable'' (that is, compatible with
the neighbourhood of  in ) --- if so,
then perform the assignment,
maintaining the elements of  in their natural order;
\item[(S5)]
if for no  is the assignment allowable,
then assign a least new letter (drawn WLOG from the set of positive integers)
to both  and ;
\item[(S6)]
since it may be that after Steps (S1)-(S5) have been executed
for every , there still remain unassigned positions in \s{x}
(that is, corresponding to isolated vertices in ),
a final assignment of a least possible letter for these positions
is required (see function  and Lemma~\ref{lemm-unassigned}).
\end{description}

In order to implement this algorithm, several data structures need
to be created, maintained, and accessed:


\begin{description}
\item[(DS1)]
The edges of  are made accessible in increasing order for Step (S1) by
a radix sort of the positive edges  into a linked list  (i.e., the linked list  contains the edges of  in increasing order),
whose entries occur in increasing order of  and, within each ,
in increasing order of .
The time requirement is , thus  in the worst case,
since  can contain  edges \cite{CRSW13}.
\item[(DS2)]
In order to implement Step (S4) of Algorithm RevEng, we need,
for each position , to have available a linked list of positions
 such that  is an edge of .
This can be done by using  to form a set of negative edges that includes
each  twice, both as  and as .
Then in a preprocessing step the entries in this set are radix sorted
into an array  of  linked lists, such that for every ,
 gives in increasing order all the vertices 
for which 
(in other words, the neighbourhood of  in ).
Since  contains  edges \cite{CRSW13},
this preprocessing step can be accomplished in  time.
\item[(DS3)]
Steps (S2)-(S5) require that for each ,
a linked list  be maintained of letters 
that have so far been assigned to .
Each list is maintained in increasing letter order,
so that update, intersection, and union each require  time,
where  is the (current) alphabet size.
Since for regular strings each  has exactly one element,
in this case processing time reduces to .
\item[(DS4)]
In Step (S4), in order to determine whether a proposed assignment
of a letter  to a position  in \s{x} is allowable or not,
we form a ``forbidden'' matrix  in which
 if and only if  is forbidden.
 is updated and used as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
for each new letter  introduced in Step (S5),
 is initialized to zero for all ;
\item
whenever an assignment 
is made in Steps (S4) \& (S5), set

\subsection{Correctness}
Consider first the main \bwhile loop of Algorithm ASSIGN,
in which the edges of  are considered in strict increasing  order.
We see that new letters  are first introduced
at the leftmost possible positions in .
Thereafter, whenever a letter is reused ( not increased),
it is always the minimum possible letter consistent with the
least possible currently unfilled positions 
that is used --- by virtue of the fact that the entries in 
are maintained in increasing order of .
Thus any automorphism of the alphabet 
other than the identity
would yield a larger string.
We conclude that within the main \bwhile loop the assignments
maintain lexicographical order 
as defined in Section~\ref{sect-prelim}.

It may happen, however, that certain positions  in  remain empty,
those corresponding to isolated vertices  in .
Assignments to these positions are handled by the final \bfor loop,
which we now consider.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemm-unassigned}
A vertex  is isolated in  if and only if
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
 or ; \band
\item[(b)]
for every , ; \band
\item[(c)]
for every , .
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
First suppose that  is isolated.
Then (a) must hold; otherwise, for  and ,
there exists an edge , a contradiction.
If (b) does not hold, there exists  such that
, implying ,
hence ,
so that , again a contradiction.
Similarly, if (c) does not hold, there exists 
such that  with .
Consequently, 
implying ,
so that , a contradiction that establishes sufficiency.

\medskip\noindent
Suppose then that conditions (a)-(c) all hold.
If we assume that  in (a), then (b) implies that
for every , , so that 
and so every position  is isolated.
Otherwise, if  for some ,
conditions (b) and (c) ensure that position  is not contained
in any matching range within \s{x} and is therefore isolated in ,
as required. \qed
\end{proof}

Since in the main \bwhile loop
new maximum letters  are introduced into pairs
 and  of positions in \s{x} that are
determined by entries in \s{y},
it is an immediate consequence of Lemma~\ref{lemm-unassigned}
that 
must be less than any isolated vertex,
in particular the smallest one, , say.
In other words, every letter assigned during the execution of the main \bwhile loop
occurs at least once to the left of  in \s{x}.
It follows that lexicographical order will be maintained
if any required additional letters 
are assigned to an ascending sequence of positions in \s{x}
determined by the isolated vertices in .
We have
\begin{lemma}
Given a prefix graph  corresponding to a feasible array , Algorithm RevEng constructs a lexicographically least indeterminate string
on a minimum alphabet whose prefix table .
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Asymptotic Complexity}
The main \bwhile loop in Algorithm RevEng will be executed exactly 
times.
Within the loop the construction of 
requires time proportional to ,
thus  in the worst case.
The processing of  then also requires  time
in the worst case, except for the time required for {\tt UPDATE\_F}.
Each of the three calls of {\tt UPDATE\_F}
corresponds to the assignment of a letter  to a vertex  of 
and the ensuing update of ,
an event that can occur at most  times for each edge in ,
thus at most  times overall.
Similarly, the \bfor loop that initializes the  array
requires  time for each of at most  values of .

We conclude that the worst-case time requirement for the \bwhile loop
is .
As illustrated by the examples
 and ,
the bounds on these quantities are as follows:
 and ,
while .
As noted earlier, it was shown in \cite{BBD14} that
, with a further conjecture that
.

Turning our attention to the terminating \bfor loop of Algorithm ASSIGN,
we observe that for at most  executions of function {\tt LEAST}, the binary array 
of length at most  must be created,
thus overall consuming  time.
The nested  loops in {\tt LEAST} set positions in   times
for at most every edge in , again requiring at most
 time over all invocations of {\tt LEAST}.
Thus
\begin{lemma}
Algorithm RevEng requires  time in the worst case,
where .
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Example}
Suppose , so that
 and .
\begin{itemize}
\item
In  first consider edge ,
leading to assignments ,
with  since both  and  are edges of .
\item
Edge  of  leads to  and no new values in ,
since vertex  is isolated in .
\item
Edge  of  requires a new letter because .
Therefore we assign  and ,
while setting  because of the edges
 and  in .
\item
Finally we deal with the isolated vertex  in 
by setting  since  and ,
while  and .
\end{itemize}
The lexicographically least string
is .


\subsection{Computational Experiments}
To get an idea of how the algorithm behaves in practice, we have implemented
Algorithm RevEng and conducted a simple experimental study. A set of 1000
feasible arrays having lengths  has been randomly generated as
follows. For each feasible array  we randomly select a value for
 from within the range . The experiments
have been run on a Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit Operating System, with
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 2600 processor @ 3.40GHz having an installed memory (RAM)
of 8.00 GB. We have implemented Algorithm RevEng in  language using Visual
Studio 2010. As is evident from Figure~\ref{fig-tests}, the experiments suggest
that average case time also increases by a factor somewhat greater than .

\section{Discussion}
\label{sect-future}
The high worst-case time complexity of the algorithm described here
suggests room for improvement. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine an algorithm
that could do the same computation without considering all the edges
of  and thus necessitating  time for many instances of
the prefix table .
Similarly, the requirement to achieve a lexicographically least solution
leads to a recurring dependence on alphabet size 
that expresses itself in the time complexity.
Even though it may be true that ,
nevertheless it seems clear that  can be much larger
than in the regular case, where it has been shown \cite{CCR09,CRSW13}
that .

We have tried approaches that focus on  rather than 
as the primary data structure, but without success.
In particular, we have considered ``triangles'' ,
where both  and  are edges in ,
while , a situation that forces a
string to be indeterminate.
It turns out, however, that the number of such triangles is .
Similarly, the ingenious graph proposed in \cite{BBD14}, 
whose chromatic number is the minimum alphabet size 
of a string corresponding to a given prefix table,
has  vertices in the worst case. 

At the same time, we have no proof that our algorithm
is asymptotically optimal; for example, an algorithm that could eliminate
the  factor in the complexity would be of considerable interest.
Also interesting would be an algorithm for indeterminate strings that would
execute in  time on regular strings as a special case, thus matching the algorithm of \cite{CCR09}.
More generally, we propose the study of indeterminate strings
(``strings'' as we have called them here),
their associated data structures (such as the prefix table),
and their applications as a promising research area
in both combinatorics on words and string algorithms.
