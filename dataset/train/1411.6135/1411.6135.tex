\begin{abstract}
Different Boolean networks may reveal similar dynamics although their definition differs, then preventing their distinction from the observations. This raises the question about the sufficiency of a particular Boolean network for properly reproducing a modeled phenomenon to make realistic predictions. The question actually depends on the invariant properties of behaviorally similar Boolean networks. In this article, we address this issue by considering that the similarity is formalized by isomorphism on graphs modeling their dynamics. The similarity also depends on the  parameter governing the
updating policy, called the mode. We define a general characterization of the group of isomorphism preserving the mode. From this characterization, we deduce invariant structural properties of the interaction graph and conditions to maintain an equivalence through mode variation.

\section{Introduction}
Boolean network is a discrete model of dynamical systems based on the evolution of Boolean states. Two components are used for the description: The \emph{evolution function} and the \emph{mode}. The evolution function reckons the state transition with respect to a mode governing the state updating policy. From these components, the dynamics is represented by a labeled transition system, called a \emph{model}, where all the paths/trajectories are computed by iterated applications of the evolution function (Section~\ref{sec:discrete-dynamics}). The mode is a parameter composed of  agent parts
determining the set of agents that could make evolve their state jointly (Section~\ref{sec:discrete-dynamics}).

Boolean network is used in biological modeling for investigating the properties of gene regulation and signal transduction networks \cite{Thomas1991,Garg2007, Demongeot2010, Delaplace2010}. The correspondence between models and observations is based on the assumption that the equilibria of the Boolean dynamics characterize the molecular signatures of observed phenotypes.  However, different models may fit to biological observations. Hence, from the observation standpoint they behave analogously. However,  they  could lead to different predictions for unobserved behaviors due to the lack of facts discriminating them. Consequently, it appears important to delineate the edges of the analogy for the reliability of model prediction.  

The analogy is defined here as an equivalence on trajectories that can be formalized by isomorphism on model: two networks are dynamically equivalent if and only if their model is isomorphic. Finding properties shared by these networks enforces the reliability of the prediction  because the predictions based on these properties remains identical for any network of the class. In this article we characterize the group of isomorphisms preserving the updating policy (\ie the mode) from which we derive the invariant properties of analogous Boolean networks. 

After introducing the formalism of Boolean networks (Section~\ref{sec:discrete-dynamics}), analogy will be formalized by an isomorphism on models (Section~\ref{sec:isomorphic-models}). The contribution is the formal characterization of the family of isomorphisms preserving the mode from which we deduce properties related to network equivalence (Section~\ref{sec:evo-fun}). These properties concern the structural invariance and condition to maintain the equivalence of Boolean networks through mode variations.

\section{Boolean networks}
\label{sec:discrete-dynamics}
Boolean networks defines the discrete evolution of Boolean \emph{state} for a population of agents. More precisely, the state of a set of agents  is a Boolean vector  indexed by . In the sequel,  denotes the state of agent , and  is a sub-vector of  collecting the states of agents belonging to . For example, given a set of agents  and a state , we deduce that:  and . Throughout the article the cardinal of  is  (\ie ). The \emph{ evolution function} is a Boolean function on states,  used to determine the stepwise evolution of states.  is  defined by a sequence of propositional formulas with the agent names as variables\footnote{We write  instead of  in the definition of the evolution function.}, for example:

We use the following notations for Boolean operations:  is the logical \textsc{or},  stands for the logical \textsc{and},  is the logical \textsc{exclusive or}, and  represents the negation of a formula.

Following the notation used for states,  defines a sub-function whose co-domain is restricted to states of  (\ie ) determining the state evolution of these agents.  extends  by completing the outcome state with the unchanged states of the agents that does not belong to :
 

An abstraction of the evolution function  is given by the \emph{signed interaction graph},  (Definition~\ref{def:interaction}) that graphically represents the interaction of the agents on the others. The \emph{signs}\footnote{ are respectively represented by , ,  in the figures.}  indicate a correlation on state variations of the connected agents: either increasing () or decreasing ().  indicates the absence of a monotone relation.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:interaction}
Let  be an evolution function, the signed interaction is a relation denoted included in . We define an \emph{interaction} on agents as: 

The signed interactions are defined as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  
\item  
\item  
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Figure~\ref{fig:inet-ex1} shows the signed interaction graph of the evolution function~(\ref{eq:ex1}).

\end{figure}

The sign of path or cycle extends the definition to a sign product of the arcs belonging to the path. For example, the sign of the cycle  is negative () in Figure~\ref{fig:inet-ex1}. Notice that, the signed interaction graph can be deduced directly from the evolution function where the formulas are in disjunctive normal form\footnote{Recall that the disjunctive normal form of a formula is a non redundant disjunction of clauses where each clause is a conjunction of literals.}. 



\subsection{Model of dynamics}
The discrete Boolean dynamics is modeled by a labeled transition systems (LTS), called the \emph{agent based modal transition system} (AMTS). It represents all the possible trajectories according to a mode. The \emph{modalities} is a set of agents defining the agents that can evolve jointly. They label the arcs. For example  means that the state of  and  will be updated and at least one of the states of these agents in  differ in .  implies that  belongs to . The different modalities are gathered into a set called a \emph{mode}. 
\begin{definition}
\label{def:amts}
An AMTS, is a labeled transition system, , where  is a set of states,  is the \emph{mode}, and  is a relation\footnote{A transition  is denoted by .} on states labeled by a \emph{modality} , such that: 
 

\noindent
 denotes the mode of .
\end{definition}
Among the possible modes, some of them are preferentially used for the Boolean discrete dynamics study. For sequential/asynchronous mode where the state of one agent only is updated by a transition,  equals the set of singletons, .  defines the \emph{parallel} mode where all the agents can evolve together. The set of part of , , corresponds to the \emph{generalized} mode encompassing all the possible modalities. The parallel and sequential modes partition\footnote{ .}  whereas the generalized mode does not unless  is reduced to a single agent. 

The \emph{spectrum} of a mode (Definition~ \ref{def:spectrum}), denoted by , abstracts the structure of a mode by collecting the number of modalities with the same cardinalities. For example, the spectrum corresponding to the following mode  is  where  means that there exists  modalities of cardinality . For  agents, the spectrum corresponding to the sequential mode is  and  for the parallel mode. 
For the generalized mode the spectrum is . 

\begin{definition}
\label{def:spectrum}
Let  be a mode, let  be the set of modalities with the same cardinality , \ie , the \emph{spectrum of} ,  is a multiset () such that: 


\end{definition}
The \emph{regular} modes corresponds to modes with a spectrum of the form  such that , namely a regular mode corresponds to a partition of the agent into modalities with same cardinality. For example, sequential and parallel modes are regular modes.

The dynamics related to a network  is represented by an AMTS modeling the trajectories on states. Then, an AMTS  \emph{models} a network if and only if the transitions are computed from the evolution function (Definition~\ref{def:model}) with respect to the mode . However, an AMTS does not necessary define a model. An AMTS is a model if and only if we can deduce the evolution functions from the transitions with respect a mode. Notice that each network has an unique model but the model varies if the mode varies.



\begin{definition}
\label{def:model}
Let  be a network for a set  of agents, an AMTS  \emph{models} the dynamics of , denoted , if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the mode is the mode of the network: 

; 
\item the states correspond to all the possible Boolean states of the agents: 

;
\item the transitions are the result of the application of the evolution function with respect to the mode:



\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Figure~\ref{fig:model1} depicts models of networks with the evolution function~(\ref{eq:ex1}) by application of the sequential and parallel modes.

\subsection{Asymptotic dynamics and equilibrium}
 An equilibrium is a specific kind of states encountered at the asymptote of the dynamics and defined as a state infinitely often met by transitions once reached, that is:

 An \emph{attractor}, , is an equilibrium set where each state (equilibrium) reaches any others (\ie ). A \emph{steady state} is a specific attractor whose cardinality equals to ,  (\ie ). In the model, an attractor is a terminal strongly connected component whereas a steady state is a sink.

Basically, two models  and  are isomorphic, , if and only if there exists a bijection  preserving the transitions:

 Hence the transitions in two isomorphic models may differ on states but preserve the trajectories. In particular, the equilibria of isomorphic models are structurally identical. 
Figure~\ref{fig:iso} shows two isomorphic models for networks with sequential mode where the states of a model correspond to the element-wise negation of the other. 

 However, the new transition relation obtained by application of an isomorphism on states may not produce a model because no mode could be found for the new transition relation (AMTS). In other words, the models are not closed by isomorphism as it is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:nomodel}. Thus, we need to check whether a mode exists for an AMTS isomorphic a model to ensure that the resulting AMTS is also a model. 

In this article, we study the isomorphisms preserving the mode. Notice that they implicitly insure the model closure by isomorphism since any isomorphic model has the same mode (\ie ). 
The set of isomorphisms preserving a particular mode forms a subgroup of the group of isomorphisms (Proposition~\ref{prop:subgroup}).

\begin{proposition} 
\label{prop:subgroup}
The set of isomorphisms preserving a spectrum or a mode forms a group.

\subsection{Notations and definitions on group}
\label{sec:definition}
In this section, we recall some definitions related to group of isomorphisms.  

\paragraph{Groups of  permutations} We use three kinds of  isomorphisms: the group of \emph{Boolean permutations} on  denoted , the group of integer permutations on  denoted  and the group of \emph{signed permutations} of rank  denoted .   is the identity of the group  (\ie ).  Throughout the article we adopt the following notations for the isomorphisms:
  stands for a Boolean permutation,  for a permutation,  for a signed permutation and  for an isomorphism preserving the mode.

The action of a permutation  on elements uses the classical exponent notation (\ie ). Its extension on sets corresponds to the action on each element (\ie ).
Notice  that the groups are defined up to an isomorphism on groups. In particular, the following equivalence is used for the proofs: .

\paragraph{Group of signed permutation}   is the group of signed permutations of rank  defined on  such that: 
 
(\eg ). The action of a signed permutation  on  is explained as permuting the sequence of s and s and then taking the negation at some positions. Given a signed permutation ,
we define  its non-signed permutation (\ie );  acts on  as follows: 

For example, the action of  on  leads to . 
A convenient representation of a signed permutation is a pair  where 
 if the  element is negated () and  otherwise. Hence, the action of  is then defined as follows\footnote{Recall that  and , .}: 

 For example, the signed permutation inverting the elements of a vector  (Figure~\ref{fig:iso}) is defined as . 

\paragraph{Representation of permutation} A permutation will be represented using the classical factorization in disjoint cycles where each cycle, written , is a permutation . For instance, the cycle  corresponds to the mapping . By convention, elements mapped to themselves are omitted like  in the example. 

\subsection{Group of isomorphisms preserving the mode}

Preserving a mode by an isomorphism depends on both a model and a mode. For instance, by considering the model of the network with the identity as evolution function, any mode is preserved by any isomorphism due to the absence of transition. However, the isomorphisms preserving a mode for this particular model may not preserve it for another model. We are seeking here for a more general notion that depends on the mode only, namely: the group of isomorphisms preserving the mode whatever the model. 

To characterize this group,  we first specifically focus on those preserving the regular mode of length  for  agents,   because they constitute the basic bricks for characterizing the group preserving the mode partitioning the agents. For example, the groups preserving the sequential and parallel modes respectively correspond to  and . The characterization of such groups follows a general scheme introduced for the group preserving the sequential mode. 

Informally the scheme is as follows: we define the group of automorphisms of a graph collecting all the models with the same set of states and the same mode. As the automorphism preserve the structure of the graph, their action on  a model corresponding to a sub-graph necessary maps in another model (sub-graph). Conversely, an isomorphism which is not an automorphism of this graph does not preserve the mode for some models. Thus, the group of the isomorphisms preserving the mode is the group of automorphisms of this graph.

\paragraph{Group of isomorphisms preserving the sequential mode}  For the sequential mode, two states are related by a transition if and only if they differ in one position only. Thus any pair of vertices differing in one position only is an arc of this graph. Hence  collecting all the models with a sequential mode generates an -dimensional hypercube  \cite{Harary1988} whose definition is based on the Hamming distance, : . Formally a -dimensional hypercube  is a graph such that: 

\medskip


\medskip
The group of automorphisms of the hypercube is also known to be isomorphic to the group of signed permutations ~\cite{Chen1993}. Hence, the order of the sub-group preserving the sequential mode for  agents is .
\begin{lemma} 
\label{lem:sequential-group}
The group of the signed permutation of rank  is isomorphic to the group preserving the asynchronism: 
\end{lemma}

\paragraph{Group of isomorphisms preserving the regular mode}
We generalize the afore result to the groups preserving a regular mode. Their characterization is based on the decomposition of graphs in a product of prime factors\footnote{A graph is prime if it is decomposed as a product of trivial graphs only, \ie  is prime if and only if:  implies that  or .}.
 The reader may refer to \cite{Imrich2008, Hammack2011, Sabidussi1959} for a coverage of the topics.

The Cartesian product of two graphs, , is a binary operation on graphs defined as follows:

\medskip
\noindent
 and,

\noindent


\medskip

First, we consider the graph union of models with a regular mode , called the \emph{complete modal graph} of , , and defined as follows:

\medskip
\noindent
 and,

\noindent
.

\medskip
A complete modal graph of a regular mode  whose length is  isomorphic to the Cartesian product of  complete graphs  (Proposition~\ref{prop:srm}). 

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:srm}
Let  be a regular mode of length , the complete modal graph  is isomorphic to .
\end{proposition}
 Hence, the group of isomorphisms preserving a regular mode of length  is isomorphic to , as  for all regular mode  of length . Lemma~\ref{lem:srm} characterizes the group of automorphisms of complete graph product in term of permutations. The order\footnote{The order of a wreath product between groups of symmetry  is .} of this group is .

\begin{lemma} 
\label{lem:srm}
The wreath product of  is isomorphic to the group preserving the regular mode of length :

\end{lemma}

The characterization of the group preserving regularity as a wreath product (Lemma~\ref{lem:srm}) leads to  a valuable representation of isomorphism preserving the regular mode for investigating the properties related to model isomorphism (Section~\ref{sec:evo-fun}).  
The wreath product is an operation on groups acting on partitioned set~\cite{Cameron1999}. An isomorphism of    is represented as a pair  where  is a function assigning a Boolean permutation of  to each  such that  acts on ; and  is an integral  permutation  leading to exchange the position of the modalities arbitrary indexed that concretely leads to an ``agent renaming'' by block of modalities. Thus, the action is in twofold: first inside each modality , by a  Boolean permutations of  acting on the sub-vector , and second among modalities by exchanging the location of the sub-vectors. The last operation can be assimilated to an ``agent renaming'' while preserving the block structure of modalities. Accordingly, the action of Boolean vectors is defined as:

For example, given the mode  the action of:
 on the following Boolean vectors\footnote{Recall that the order of states in a Boolean vector is  by convention.} is:
 


 Lemma~\ref{lem:srm} generalizes Lemma~\ref{lem:sequential-group}. Indeed, the group  is isomorphic to the group of the signed permutations , (\ie )~\cite{Harary2000}.
Notice that the group of isomorphism preserving the parallel mode  is obviously isomorphic to the group of all Boolean permutations  ().

\paragraph{Group of isomorphisms preserving partition}    is the group preserving the partition  of . As mode  can be defined as an union of regular sub-modes  such that ,  the spectrum is of the form .   is proved to be the product of isomorphisms preserving regular mode (Theorem~\ref{the:sm}). 
\begin{theorem} 
\label{the:sm}
The set of isomorphisms on models preserving a mode partitioning the agents, the spectrum of which is , is the group defined as the Cartesian product of their regular modes:

\end{theorem}
Thus, the order of this group is .
The isomorphisms of   are also represented by a pair  respectively referring to a collection of Boolean permutations and a permutation on modalities. However,  is constrained by the fact that only the permutations of modalities with the same cardinalities are allowed. Thereby the action of an isomorphism  is also defined by (\ref{eq:action}). By extension, the  action on transitions  is defined as:







\section{Equivalence on networks}
\label{sec:evo-fun}
The equivalence formalizes the analogy on the behaviors of networks with the same mode but with different evolution functions.  Two networks with identical modes are \emph{dynamically equivalent} () if and only if their model is isomorphic with respect to  group (Definition~\ref{def:equivnet}).
\begin{definition}
\label{def:equivnet}

\end{definition}

 Hence, there exists at most  equivalent networks to network . 
The following property deduced from (\ref{eq:equiv-iso}) defines the relation on the functions of two equivalent networks: if  with respect to  we have:

\label{fig:mode-depend}
\end{figure}
In this section, we study the structural invariance property of equivalent networks and conditions for preserving the equivalence across different modes. The structural invariance property aims at characterizing a structure abstracting a network such that these structures are isomorphic for equivalent networks. Preserving the equivalence while changing the mode implies to identify properties insuring that an equivalence found for a mode is also preserved for another.
 In fact, the equivalence may not be preserved by mode variation in general. Figure~\ref{fig:mode-depend} shows an example where the models are isomorphic for the parallel mode and not for the sequential one. Moreover, it also shows that the interaction graph is not an invariant structure. These two properties actually depend on more complex relations on modes. 

\subsection{Structural invariance} Although an interaction graph is not an invariant structure (\cf Figure~\ref{fig:mode-depend}), another structure derived from it, called the \emph{interaction modal graph} (IMG), proves to be invariant for equivalent networks (Lemma~\ref{lem:invariant}). The IMG is defined as the unsigned quotient interaction graph induced by a mode~(Definition~\ref{def:img}) where vertices are modalities and the edge set represents the quotient relation of the interactions with regard to a mode. 

\begin{definition}
\label{def:img}
Let  be an interaction graph of  and  a mode partitioning , the \emph{interaction modal graph} (IMG) of  for , , is the unsigned quotient interaction digraph induced by  defined as:

\item ;

\caption{Analysis of all the equivalent networks with

	\label{fig:img}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:img} describes the exhaustive analysis of the networks equivalent to the network . The regular group corresponding to the mode is  whose order is .
 All the functions of equivalent networks have been inferred from the isomorphic models obtained by application of the isomorphisms of  to the model of the studied function. The interaction graphs of all the functions follow  patterns but signs and locations of agents vary. 
For each pattern, the number of related interaction graphs is reported below. 
They confirm that interaction graphs of functions for equivalent networks are not isomorphic because the patterns are not. Finally, 2 isomorphic interactions modal graphs are derived from them.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:invariant} 
 The IMGs of equivalent networks are isomorphic: 

\end{lemma}
Consequently the interaction graphs of two equivalent networks for the sequential mode are isomorphic because 
 the IMG is the unsigned version of the interaction graph. Moreover, we can reckon the sign of the interactions of the interaction graph directly from the interaction of the other by the function  (Lemma~\ref{lem:equiv-async} ):

 is extended to interaction graph by applying the function on each arc of the graph. For example, the functions defined in Figure~\ref{fig:iso} are equivalent (with  and ) with the same interaction graph.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:equiv-async}
Let  be two networks equivalent for the sequential mode with respect to the signed permutation , we have:  
\end{lemma}
Thereby, the isomorphic cycles (\ie with the same agents up to a permutation by ) of  and  are of the same sign but the sign of their interactions may differ (Corollary~\ref{cor:equiv-async}).
\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:equiv-async}
The isomorphic cycles by  in  and  are of the same sign.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Equivalence through mode variation}
Although the equivalence closely depends on the mode, it may be preserved from a mode to another by mode \emph{embedding} (Definition~\ref{def:piembed}).

Let  and  be two modes partitioning , let  be a permutation, \emph{ is -embedded} into  if and only if: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each modality of  are included in a modality of :

; \label{cond1}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:fun-equivalent}
 Two networks equivalent for a mode with respect to an isomorphism  are also equivalent for any mode -embedding this mode.
\end{lemma}
Hence, an equivalence found with the sequential mode also holds for any mode since the sequential mode is embedded in all modes. An equivalence found for any mode also holds for the parallel mode since the parallel mode embeds all modes.

As a particular result found in \cite{Jarrah2010} and generalized in this article, a function in conjunctive normal form is equivalent to another function where \textsc{or} operators are merely replaced by the \textsc{and} operators and conversely (Figure~\ref{fig:iso}) for any mode. Indeed, 
for sequential mode, when  corresponding to a complete negation of agents and  is the identity (), the following property can be deduced from~(\ref{eq:equiv-fun}) that  as the inverse of the negation is the negation itself. From this equation, by application of the Morgan law and change of variables, from a function in disjunctive normal form  we obtain an equivalent function  available for any mode where \textsc{or} are exchanged by \textsc{and} and conversely. 

 The equivalence properties of interaction graphs based on model isomorphism have also been studied by \cite{Noual2012}. The author proves that the models of two functions with the same non-signed interaction graph where each non-cyclic path has the same sign (\ie canonical form) are isomorphic at the asymptote for the generalized mode.

\section{Conclusion}
Isomorphism on the models of dynamics formalizes the analogy on  Boolean networks. 
The study characterizes the group of isomorphisms preserving the mode from which we deduce an equivalence on networks based on the isomorphism of their model. It reveals that the equivalence strongly depends on the mode: two equivalent networks may loose the equivalence when the mode varies. In this context, we show that the equivalence is maintained providing a mode is embedded in another. Besides, we show that the equivalence also induces an equivalence on a structure called the interaction modal graphs of the networks. This property is completed by an equivalence of the sign of the cycle for the sequential mode.

Several perspectives are considered. The characterization of the group could be extended to groups of isomorphisms preserving the spectrum. If these groups coincide for sequential and parallel mode because the mode can be trivially deduced from the spectrum without ambiguity, they differ for the other modes. This perspective enables the definition of a larger class of behaviorally similar Boolean networks while remaining close to the initial parametrization of model. Another perspective is related to the canonical form of networks resulting to  a transform of the network to a canonical representation dynamically equivalent to the original one. The canonical form is considered as the representative of a class of networks.
 The issue is to deduce properties of the dynamics of the network from the canonical form.

\begin{proof}[Proposition~\ref{prop:subgroup}]
A Boolean permutation  preserves the mode  if and only if: 


Let  be a model with a mode , we prove that:
\begin{itemize}
\item the group is closed by composition. Let  be two Boolean permutations preserving the mode , we have: 

 since  and  also preserves the mode .
\item the identity (neutral element)  preserves the mode since 

.
\item if  preserves the mode  then the inverse  also preserves the mode. 
Assume that  does not preserve a mode , we have:

 and  which is false by hypothesis.
\end{itemize} 
\qed \end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Lemma~\ref{lem:sequential-group}] 
Let  be a model with a sequential mode  , by definition of the mode for all states  and all modalities :   implies that . Thus, the arcs of the model are also arcs of the  dimensional hypercube.

\noindent
 As the automorphisms of the hypercube map any arc to other arc of the hypercube, the condition of the sequential mode are preserved because a model with a sequential mode is always a sub-graph of the hypercube. Thus, the sequential mode is preserved by an automorphism of the hypercube for all models. 

\noindent
\medskip
 
By definition an automorphism of the hypercube the Boolean permutation  complies to the following property: 
 
Thus, if  is not an automorphism of the hypercube then there is an arc  such that: , meaning that the mode is not preserved for the models because the transition  does not correspond to the state change of one agent only.

We conclude that the automorphisms of the hypercube are the isomorphisms preserving the sequential mode for all models. The automorphisms of the dimensional hypercube~\cite{Harary2000, Chen1993} is also  isomorphic to the group of the signed permutation of rank  or the Hyperoctahedral group of rank  and denoted .
\qed \end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proposition~\ref{prop:srm}]
We prove that  is isomorphic to the graph resulting of the cartesian product of  complete graphs , . 

Without loss of generality, we assume that: . For simplicity, the modalities of  will be arbitrary indexed, \ie . 

\medskip
\noindent
Let  be a function mapping the vertices of  to the vertices of ,  is defined as follows:



\medskip
\noindent
 In other words, the Boolean vector  is re-ordered such that  is mapped to a sub-vector of  starting at position , 
\medskip
\noindent
 is a bijection because  re-orders the  sub-vectors of length  and no sub-vectors are overlapped due to the fact that  is a partition.

\medskip
\noindent
Now, let us check that: . 

\noindent
 By definition, for all  there exists  such that: 
 

\noindent
We prove that  . 
 Let  and ,  we deduce that there exists an edge 
 because  by hypothesis and the  graph in the product is a complete graph. Hence, we conclude that: 

\noindent


\medskip
\noindent
As  is a bijection, we conclude that .
\qed \end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Lemma~\ref{lem:srm}]
From Proposition~\ref{prop:srm}, we deduce that for any regular mode  of length , .
Thus, we focus on the characterization of . A complete graph is prime with respect to the Cartesian product beacuse there is no induced square (cycle)~\cite{Imrich2008}. Hence,  is also relatively prime with itself. Accordingly, the following property holds (\cite{Hammack2011}~Corollary~6.12, p.~70): 
  
As  and , we deduce that: 

In conclusion, for all models  such that the spectrum is , , we have:
 
 As  defines the set of isomorphisms preserving the mode of , we conclude that: 
\qed \end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Theorem~\ref{the:sm}]

Let  be a mode partitioning the agents such that , We define  as regular sub modes of , such that  and . 
The graph encompassing all the state graphs according to the mode  is the cartesian product of graphs related to sub-mode :


\medskip 
\noindent
Proposition~\ref{prop:srm} demonstrates that  is isomorphic to . Hence, we deduce that  is isomorphic to:
  

\medskip
\noindent
Now, we focus on the characterization of the automorphisms of .
Two products of complete graphs  and  such that  are relatively prime. Indeed, a complete graph is prime and then cannot be generated from a product of complete graphs. Hence, a product of complete graphs is relatively prime to a product of another complete graph if the cardinality of the vertices differ. Then,  is defined by its prime decomposition of complete graphs. As a complete graph  is isomorphic to itself only according to the decomposition and prime, two cartesian products of complete graphs of different cardinality are not isomorphic and relatively prime. We deduce that: 

(See \cite{Hammack2011} Theorem~6.10 and Theorem~6.13, pp.~68--69)
 
\medskip
\noindent
By application of Lemma~\ref{lem:srm}, we conclude that:

\qed \end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Lemma~\ref{lem:invariant}]
First, let us  define the interactions for modalities of   extending Definition~\ref{def:interaction}:


For two equivalent networks  and ,  there exists an isomorphism  such that for all transitions of the model of ,  there exists exactly one transition  in the model of  ( Definition\ref{def:equivnet} and Property~\ref{eq:equiv-iso} ). We prove that  is the isomorphisms between IMGs of  and . More precisely,  For all interactions  of the IMGs of  we prove that there exists an unique interaction  in the IMG of  and conversely.  

\medskip 
By definition of interactions (Definition~\ref{def:interaction}), for all interactions  of the IMG of , we deduce that there exists two states  such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \label{inv:a}
\item  \label{inv:b}
\item  \label{inv:c}
\end{enumerate}

By definition of , the isomorphism acts locally on each modality, , such that  is a permutation acting on . Then the result is permuted with respect to the permutation on modalities (). Hence, for all modalities  
we deduce that: 
 \begin{enumerate}
\item  because  is a permutation  acting locally on  the part of  and (\ref{inv:a}).
\item  because  are permutations and (\ref{inv:b}). 
 \item  because  is a permutation and (\ref{inv:c}).
\end{enumerate}
Hence, as  is a permutation  we deduce that there exists an unique interaction  in the IMG of . 

\medskip
\noindent
 Thus, we conclude that the IMGs of the two functions are isomorphic and  is the isomorphism.
\qed \end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Lemma~\ref{lem:equiv-async}]
The proof is based on the definition of  from  for all  leading to a relation between the two interaction graphs . the mode  is sequential. Without loss of generality, we assume that .

\medskip
\noindent
From Equation~\ref{eq:action}, we deduce that two equivalent networks,  such that  and  are related by the following equation:  , for all  and for all . In the context of the sequential mode with an action defined by a Boolean vector as a representation of a signed permutation: ,
the equation becomes: 
Setting  and by a change of variable (),  is defined as:

because .

 Now, the issue is to characterize the formula of the local evolution function  by considering the permutation.
  is a formula in disjunctive normal form (DNF) for all . By definition of , we have:

																																										
The negation of a formula in disjunctive normal form leads to a formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) by application of the Morgan law where the literals are the negation of the disjunctive normal form (DNF).
Besides, since the conversion between CNF and DNF of a formula involves the distributivity and the associativity and does not require the application of the negation, the both representations of a formula have the same set of literals. Therefore, 
let  be the set of literals of formula  in DNF, (\eg ), we have the following property: 

 where .
	
\noindent
As,  has the same variables than  for all , we deduce that the interaction graph is the same, meaning the graphs differ by the sign of their interactions only.

\medskip
\noindent
Now, we focus on the rules modifying the signs.
 Let  be a positive interaction of , we deduce the following rules from Equation~(\ref{eq:fprime}): 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c p{.5\textwidth}}
  &  &  & Comments\\
\hline
 &  &  & no change since \\
 &  &  & since  implies the negation of  (Equation~\ref{eq:fprime}) \\
 &  &  & since  \\
 &  &  & since  is the negation of  (), but applied on the negation of  (). Hence 
The literal related to  occurring in  is . \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\medskip
A similar analysis can be developed for a negative interaction. The literals belonging to  are then the negation of the literal occurring in the table. For similar reasons, no change occurs for the non-monotone interactions (sign = ).
Finally, the expression , where  is the sign and , characterizes these rules concisely. 

In conclusion, 
 is completely defined from  and  for all , leading to  where  operates on the interactions of  as follows: .
\qed \end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Corollary~\ref{cor:equiv-async}]
Given a cycle occurring in the two interaction graphs,  \wrt equivalent network for the sequential mode with functions , we define  as the sequence of the signs for the cycle in  by considering that each interaction of the cycle is of the form: , such that the agents  belong the cycle. For the sake of simplicity we consider that .

\medskip
\noindent
From Lemma~\ref{lem:equiv-async}, we deduce that  is the sequence of the signs for  where  is the Boolean vector representing the isomorphism between the models. The sign of the cycle in  is  and the sign of the cycle in  is . The expression of the sign of the cycle in  can be simplified leading to the following expression:
 
As , we conclude that . The signs of the both cycles are identical \qed 
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Lemma~\ref{lem:fun-equivalent}]
We prove that if  embeds  then for two equivalent function with respect to ,  is also an isomorphism of . Hence, we prove that  preserves the mode .

\paragraph{ preserves the mode }
As  and for all , each  acts locally on , we deduce that if   also acts locally on . As each  is necessary included in a modality , we deduce that  does not change the mode. 

\paragraph{ preserves the mode }
 is a permutation of  if and only if  is a permutation of modalities of  and the permutation is applied on modalities with the same cardinality.

\medskip
According to Definition~\ref{def:piembed}.\ref{cond1} and as  and  form partitions of , all the modalities of  correspond to a partition of modality of . Beside the modalities of the image by ,  also form a partition of another modality (Definition~\ref{def:piembed}.\ref{cond2}). Hence,  permutes modalities of .

Now let us check that  is a permutation on modalities of  with the same cardinality.
As  preserves the mode  by hypothesis, we have . Hence, let  be a modality such that, 
, as  is a partition of ,
and  is a permutation complying to rules of a  group mapping modalities on modalities of the same cardinality, we deduce that a modality of  mapped by  to another modality of  have the same cardinality: 
. 

\medskip
As  and  preserve the mode , we conclude that . However, its representation as a pair  is different. 
\qed \end{proof}
