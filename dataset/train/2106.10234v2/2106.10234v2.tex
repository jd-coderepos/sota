\begin{abstract}
Inspired by its success in natural language processing and computer vision, pre-training has attracted substantial attention in cheminformatics and bioinformatics, especially for molecule based tasks. A molecule can be represented by either a graph (where atoms are connected by bonds) or a SMILES sequence (where depth-first-search is applied to the molecular graph with specific rules). Existing works on molecule pre-training use either graph representations only or SMILES representations only. In this work, we propose to leverage both the representations and design a new pre-training algorithm, dual-view molecule pre-training (briefly, \ourM{}), that can effectively combine the strengths of both types of molecule representations. The model of \ourM{} consists of two branches: a Transformer branch that takes the SMILES sequence of a molecule as input, and a GNN branch that takes a molecular graph as input. The training of \ourM{} contains three tasks: (1) predicting masked tokens in a SMILES sequence by the Transformer branch, (2) predicting masked atoms in a molecular graph by the GNN branch, and (3) maximizing the consistency between the two high-level representations output by the Transformer and GNN branches separately. After pre-training, we can use either the Transformer branch (this one is recommended according to empirical results), the GNN branch, or both for downstream tasks. \ourM{} is tested on nine molecular property prediction tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performances on seven of them. Furthermore, we test \ourM{} on three retrosynthesis tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on them.

\section{Introduction}
While machine learning (especially deep learning) techniques have been applied to cheminformatics and bioinformatics with significant progress~\cite{huang2016communication,david2020molecular}, their potential is severely limited by the scale of labeled data since it is more costly and time consuming to collect labeled data for tasks in cheminformatics and bioinformatics than those tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the great success of exploiting unlabeled data in CV and NLP  \cite{he2020momentum,grill2020bootstrap}, pre-training has been introduced into cheminformatics~\cite{hu2019strategies,chithrananda2020chemberta,wang2021molclr} and bioinformatics~\cite{rao2019evaluating,ESMpaper}. Among those  pre-training works, molecule pre-training has attracted much attention since molecules are a kind of basic units and play a fundamental  role in drug discovery and chemical modeling.

Molecules can be represented in different formats. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:framework}, a molecule can be represented by a molecular graph, where nodes and edges are atoms and bonds respectively. This is the most intuitive way to visualize a molecule. By traversing the graph using depth first search and some predefined rules, the same molecule can be represented by a SMILES\footnote{SMILES is short for simplified molecular-input line-entry system.} \cite{weininger1988smiles} sequence. In almost all molecular database like PubChem~\cite{10.1093/nar/gkaa971} and ZINC~\cite{doi:10.1021/ci049714}, SMILES representations are used due to its simplicity. Correspondingly, there are mainly two lines of works on molecule pre-training, which are built upon graphs or  SMILES sequences. For pre-training on graphs \citep{hu2019strategies,liu2019ngram,wang2021molclr}, graph neural networks (GNNs) are used as backbone models, which explicitly leverages the structural information of a molecule. \citet{hu2019strategies} proposed two pre-training techniques based on GNNs: one is to predict masked atoms or bonds, and the other is to preserve the similarity between a -hop subgraph of some anchor point  and its corresponding context graph (i.e., a ring surrounding ). \citet{wang2021molclr} applied contrastive learning~\cite{1640964} to molecule pre-training, where the representations of a molecule extracted by a GNN are forced to be similar to another augmented version of itself while dissimilar to other molecules. For pre-training on SMILES sequences \citep{chithrananda2020chemberta}, they are treated in a similar way to natural language sequence and Transformer~\cite{vaswani2017attention}, a widely used model in NLP, is adopted as the backbone.. 

Although different methods have been proposed for molecule pre-training, to our best knowledge, almost all of them only use one kind of molecule representations, either dealing with graphs using GNN only or dealing with SMILES sequences using Transformer only. However, the two types of models have their own strengths and limitations, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:case_study_in_motivation}. Transformer correctly predicts the properties of molecules in Figure~\ref{fig:case_study_in_motivation}(a), whose maximal node/atom distance is large, but fails on the molecules in Figure~\ref{fig:case_study_in_motivation}(b) which has more than three rings concatenated together.
In contrast, GNN correctly classifies the molecules in Figure~\ref{fig:case_study_in_motivation}(b) but fails in Figure~\ref{fig:case_study_in_motivation}(a). This suggests that the two views are complementary to each other.

    \label{fig:case_study_in_motivation}
\end{figure}


In this work, we propose a novel pre-training method, {\it dual-view molecule pre-training} (briefly, \ourM{}), to combine the best of two worlds. In \ourM{}, a molecule  is represented by both a SMILES sequence  and a graph .  is encoded by a Transformer branch which outputs a high-level representation , and  is encoded by a GNN branch which outputs another high-level representation . Since  and  are representations of the same molecule, they should be similar in some latent space. To achieve this, inspired by the BYOL scheme~\cite{BYOL2020}, we propose the {\it dual-view consistency objective}, where the cosine similarity between the projected variants  and  should be maximized. In addition, we also adopt the masked language modeling (MLM)~\cite{hu2019strategies,chithrananda2020chemberta,devlin2018bert} objective. Specifically, for the Transformer branch, we randomly mask some tokens (e.g., atoms or bonds) in a SMILES sequence and recover them; for the GNN branch, we randomly mask some atoms and reconstruct them. After pre-training, we can use the Transformer branch, the GNN branch or both for downstream tasks. We recommend using the Transformer branch according to empirical results, which do not introduce extra parameters for downstream tasks compared to standard Transformer while the accuracy is promising. 

To test \ourM{}, we first pre-train on  molecules from PubChem\footnote{\url{https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/}} following previous work~\cite{chithrananda2020chemberta,wang2021molclr}, and then finetune on  molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet \citep{wu2018moleculenet} and three retrosynthesis tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art results on  out of  prediction tasks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. Specifically, on the classification tasks of MoleculeNet, \ourM{} outperforms MolCLR~\cite{wang2021molclr} and GROVER~\cite{rong2020self} by  and  points on average; on retrosynthesis, we  achieve -point improvements of top-1 accuracy across 3 different settings and achieve state-of-the-art results on them \citep{GLN,NEURIPS2020_819f46e5,tetko2020state}. After that, we conduct pre-training on  compounds from PubChem, and we find the results can be slightly improved. After using our method, we can successfully predict the properties 
of molecules with long chains and rich structured groups (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:case_study_in_motivation}(c)), where both standard Transformer only and GNN fail.

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

\noindent(1) To our best knowledge, we are the first to conduct molecule pre-training taking the advantages of the two different views (i.e., SMILES and molecular graphs).

\noindent(2) In addition to MLM, \ourM{}~leverages dual-view consistency loss for pre-training, which explicitly exploits the consistency of representations between two views of molecules.

\noindent(3) We achieve state-of-the-art results on  molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet~\cite{wu2018moleculenet} and three retrosynthesis tasks (i.e., a kind of molecule generation task), demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of \ourM{}. 



\section{Related work}


In this section, we briefly summarize molecule pre-training based on Transformer and GNN. 

\noindent{\bf Transformer-based pre-training}: Transformer~\cite{vaswani2017attention} is originally proposed for sequence learning in NLP, and then widely adopted by other applications, such as speech processing \cite{8462506,NEURIPS2019_f63f65b5}, CV \citep{dosovitskiy2021an,image2018imagetransformer}, and also, cheminformatics. To leverage Transformer-based molecule pre-training, people regard SMILES sequences as natural languages and apply the techniques of pre-training in NLP. Similar to~\cite{devlin2018bert,liu2019roberta} which mainly uses masked language modeling, \citet{wang2019smiles} proposed SMILES-BERT and \citet{chithrananda2020chemberta} ChemBERTa, which is to apply masked language modeling to molecule pre-training. 
\citet{fabian2020molecular} introduced additional tasks to SMILES-based molecule pre-training, like predicting whether two SMILES represent the same molecule, or predicting whether some molecular descriptors obtained by RDKit exist in a molecule.
\citet{honda2019smiles} used auto-encoder to obtain a neural-based fingerprint. \citet{maziarka2020molecule} improved self-attention with inter-atomic distances and molecular graph structure. In addition, there are some works about SMILES-based molecule generation \citep{schwaller2019molecular,pesciullesi2020transfer} and optimization \citep{he2021transformer}. 

\noindent{\bf GNN-based pre-training}: \citet{hu2019strategies} used a GNN to encode the input molecule, and proposed two pre-training strategies, where we should either recover the masked attributes of the input (e.g., atom type), or use constrastive learning~\cite{1640964,chen2020simple} to minimize the difference between two subgraphs of within a molecule. A similar idea also exists in \citet{li2020learn}. \citet{wang2021molclr} applied contrastive learning across different molecules and proposed MolCLR, where a molecule should be similar to an augmented version of itself while dissimilar to others. \citet{liu2019ngram} proposed an -gram graph to represent molecules: it first learns the representations of atoms using CBoW~\cite{mikolov2013efficient}, and then enumerates -grams (i.e., a walk of length ) in the graph and the final representation is constructed based on the embeddings of all its -grams. \citet{shen2020molgnn} leveraged both edge-level reconstruction and motif-level reconstruction. \citet{rong2020self} proposed GROVER, which replaces the self-attention layer in Transformer where the number of hops are adaptively determined, and design new pre-training objective functions: one about predicting the statistics of the molecule and the other is the predict the existence of some function groups. To our best knowledge, almost all previous works treat Transformer-based pre-training and GNN-based pre-training independently, and we propose to leverage them together.

\section{Our method}
In this section, we first introduce the network architecture, followed by the training objective functions of our method, and finally provide discussions about related methods and limitations.

\subsection{Network architecture}
Given a molecule , let  and  denote the SMILES and molecular graph respectively. Define  as , where  is the length of .
Define  as a graph , where  is a collection of atoms, and  is the collection of edges\footnote{ since the bonds, numbers and brackets are also included in the SMILES as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:framework}.}. In a molecule, the bond has several types (e.g., single bond, double bonds, aromatic compounds), which is also modeled. 

The network architecture of our method consists of two branches, one is a GNN, which is used to encode its graph view , and the other one is a Transformer, which is to encode its sequence view . Denote the above two models as  and , which have  and  layers, respectively.

\noindent(1) For the GNN branch, following~\cite{li2020deepergcn}, we choose the DeeperGCN network as the backbone. DeeperGCN is a stack of multiple GCN layers~\cite{kipf2016semi}, where the batch normalization~\cite{ioffe2015batch}, non-linear activation and residual connections~\cite{he2016deep} are all used. The information among atoms are propagated along bonds, and the embedding of bond property (i.e., double bond, single bond) is added to atoms. Details of DeeperGCN are left in Appendix \ref{appendix:deepergcn} of the supplementary document. After encoded by the  layers, each atom has a representation outputted by the last layer of DeeperGCN, i.e., , where  is the representation of the -th atom. We then choose a pooling function  (e.g., mean pooling, max pooling) and obtain the representation of the molecule, i.e., . 

\noindent(2) For the Transformer branch, we choose the RoBERTa model~\cite{liu2019roberta}, which encodes the SMILES sequence  of the molecule. Following \cite{liu2019roberta,devlin2018bert}, we add a special token \texttt{[CLS]} to the beginning of the sequence. We also use the output of the last layer as the representations of \texttt{[CLS]} and tokens, i.e., , where  corresponds to \texttt{[CLS]} and  corresponds to the -th element in the SMILES sequence. In this way, the molecule representation of  is , i.e., .





\iffalse
For a fair comparison, we use the similar backbone architecture for each branch without much modification. Specifically, for Transformer branch, we use the same architecture as RoBERTa \cite{liu2019roberta}, consisting of  layer of Transformer encoder \cite{vaswani2017attention}, to map , a sequence of discrete tokens into a sequence of continuous representation . Following prior work, we append a \texttt{[CLS]} token to represent the sequence representation  when pre-training and finetuning . For GNN branch, to match the depth of Transformer branch, following DeeperGCN \cite{li2020deepergcn}, we stack the same  layer of GNN block by introducing the residual connection. The GNN transforms the graph view , consisting of atoms and bonds into a set of node embeddings . Last, we pool the node embeddings to get graph embedding . 
\fi



\subsection{Training objective functions}
Our method consists of three training objective functions, including two masked language modeling (MLM) loss and one dual-view consistency loss.

\noindent(1) {\bf MLM on Transformer}: Given a SMILES sequence, we randomly mask some tokens, and the objective is to recover  the original tokens, following the practice in NLP pre-training~\cite{devlin2018bert,liu2019roberta}.

\iffalse
After applying random masking to , denote the corrupted sequence as . Mathematically, the MLM loss of the Transformer branch is

where  is the indicator function.
\fi

\noindent(2) {\bf MLM on GNN}: Similar to the MLM on Transformer, we randomly mask some atoms in a molecular graph (the bonds remain unchanged), and the objective is to recover the original atoms, following the practice in graph pre-training~\cite{hu2019strategies}.


\iffalse
\noindent(2) {\bf MLM on Graphs}: Similar to the MLM on Transformer, define the augmented version of the graph  as , where we randomly replace some atoms to \texttt{[mask]} while the bonds remain unchanged. Denote the corrupted atoms as .  The MLM loss for graph is:

\fi
\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption{The illustration of our dual-view consistency loss. "SG" indicates the stop-gradient when back-propagating.}
    \label{fig:framework}
\end{figure}
\noindent(3) \textbf{Dual-view consistency}: To model the interaction between the GNN and the Transformer, inspired by the BYOL~\cite{BYOL2020}, we propose a dual-view consistency loss, that models the similarity of the output between GNN and Transformer. Based on the empirical discovery of~\cite{BYOL2020}, we introduce two non-linear projection layers ,  and two prediction layers  and . For the SMILES view  and 
the graph view  of a molecule, we randomly mask some tokens/atoms and obtain  and .
 is obtained by  and  is the first output of , which corresponds to the \texttt{[CLS]} token.
After that, we  apply the projection and prediction layers to them, i.e., 

Since 's and 's are the representation of the same molecule but from different views, they should preserve enough similarity. Let  denote the cosine similarity between  and , i.e., . Following~\cite{BYOL2020}, the dual-view consistency loss is defined as 

In Eqn.\eqref{eq:dual_view_loss},  means that the gradient is not applied to  when back-propagating, and neither is .

\iffalse
The overall loss function is:

where two MLM loss functions are normalized by the numbers of masked tokens in  and masked atoms in , so that their magnitudes are comparable to the dual-view loss.
\fi

After pre-training, we can use the Transformer branch, the GNN branch or both for downstream tasks. According to our empirical study, for molecular prediction tasks, we recommend using the Transformer branch. Using both branches brings further improvement at the cost of larger model size.



\iffalse
We apply the BYOL-like Prediction on the sequence representation  and graph embedding . Motivate by BYOL~\cite{BYOL2020} where they use the momentum-updated backup of encoder to boost the online encoder, we use the different view of the same molecule and the different model architecture to boost the representation of one different view and encoder. Specifically, assuming that we have gotten the sequence representation  and graph embedding , we want to maximize the cosine similarity of these two representation in representation space. Similar to prior works \cite{BYOL2020,chen2020big}, we augment each branch with a projector  or  and a predictor  or . Thus we first define the normalized cosine similarity score of vector  and  as 

where  is the cosine distance of  and . Then we define the BYOL-like Prediction loss as

where  means the stop gradient operation.
\fi

\subsection{Discussions}
(1) {\it Relation with co-training}: Considering there are two ``views'' in our method, people might be curious the the relation with co-training, which also leveraged two views. Co-training~\cite{blum1998combining} is a semi-supervised learning method that can be used to construct additional labeled data. The basic assumption to use co-training is that the features can be divided into two conditionally independent sets (i.e., views), where each set is sufficient to train a classifier. Each classifier provides the most confident predictions on the unlabeled data as the additional labeled data. 
In comparison, \ourM{} is an algorithm which does not need the independent assumption. \ourM{} provides a pre-trained model for downstream tasks instead of newly labeled data.

In addition, there are some work leveraging multiple views for pre-training, but the views are usually from the same model instead of two heterogeneous ones (Transformer vs GNN). In \citep{ma2020multi}, the two views are the outputs of a node-central encoder and an edge-central encode. In \citep{hassani2020contrastive}, the two views of a graph are the first-order neighbors
and a graph diffusion. Those methods are significantly different from ours.

(2) {\it Limitations of our method}:\label{discussion_limitation} Our method has two limitations. First, there is a Transformer branch and a GNN branch in our method, which increases the training cost comparing with previous single-branch pre-training~\cite{chithrananda2020chemberta,wang2021molclr}. How to design an efficient pre-training method is an interesting future direction. Second, in downstream tasks, we deal with all molecules using either the Transformer branch or the GNN branch. Recent studies show that a better solution is to use a meta-controller to dynamically determine which branch to use~\cite{zhu2021iot,elbayad2019depth} for an individual input. We will also explore this dynamic branch selection in future. 



  

 
\section{Experiments}
In this section, first, we introduce the data and model architecture for pre-training. Second, we apply our pre-trained models to nine molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet~\cite{wu2018moleculenet}. Next, we evaluate our method on three retrosynthesis tasks, including USPTO-50k with reaction type known/unknown and USPTO-full~\cite{tetko2020state}. Finally, we visualize the representations of different pre-trained models for comparison.
\subsection{Pre-training}
\noindent\textbf{Dataset}
For pre-training, we choose two subsets from PubChem, one with  compounds which are the same as those in \cite{wang2021molclr,chithrananda2020chemberta}, and the other with  compounds. We first use the RDkit toolkit\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit}} to process the input. For the input of Transformer branch, we canonicalize SMILES sequences and then tokenize the canonicalized SMILES using the same regular expression as \cite{schwaller2019molecular}. For the input of the GNN branch, we convert the SMILES to molecular graphs using RDKit. 


\noindent\textbf{Model Architecture}
The Transformer branch is the same as the RoBERTa architecture, which consists of   layers. The hidden dimension, the dimension of the feed-forward layer, and the number of heads are ,  and , respectively. The GNN branch follows the DeeperGCN \citep{li2020deepergcn} backbone, which is a -layer network. The hidden dimension of the GNN branch is . The graph pooling function above the last layer is the concatenation of \texttt{mean} and \texttt{max} operations. 

Following \cite{chen2020simple, BYOL2020}, the projection heads (i.e.,  and ) are 3-layer MLP networks, and the prediction heads (i.e.,  and ) are 2-layer MLP networks. All hidden layers in the MLPs are followed by the \texttt{ReLU} and \texttt{BatchNorm} \citep{ioffe2015batch}, while the output layers are not. 


\noindent\textbf{Optimization}
Our model is optimized by Adam \citep{kingma2014adam} algorithm with learning rate , , , . The weight decay is . The learning rate is warmed up in the first  update steps and then linearly decayed. All pre-training experiments are conducted on V100 GPUs and the batch size is  tokens. The  gradients are accumulated for  times. The models are trained for  iterations. 

\subsection{Molecular property prediction}
\noindent\textbf{Dataset} 
After pre-training, we first finetune our model on 6 datasets from MoleculeNet~\cite{wu2018moleculenet}, a popular well-curated benchmark for molecular property prediction. Note that each dataset might be associated with multiple tasks. There are  tasks in total, and they cover a wide range of data volumes. On one hand, following \cite{wang2021molclr}, we use the official training, validation and test sets provided by DeepChem~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem}}, whose performance is relatively stable and reproducible.
On the other hand, to compare with  \citep{rong2020self,li2020learn}, we follow their ways to split the data and conduct another group of experiments. Specifically, we use {\it scaffold splitter} to generate the training (), validation () and test () sets with 3 different seeds. We compare with \citep{rong2020self,li2020learn} on three classification and three regression tasks. 


\noindent\textbf{Finetuning settings} Following \cite{liu2019ngram,wang2021molclr}, each task is independently finetuned. We explore finetuning on the Transformer branch, the GNN branch and both. The classification/regression head is a -layer MLP with \texttt{tanh} activation, which takes the representation of \texttt{[CLS]} (i.e., ) and/or the graph pooling over GNN (i.e., ) as input. Detailed hyper-parameters are left in Appendix \ref{appendix:finetuninghyperparaments}.

\noindent\textbf{Evaluation}
Following \cite{wu2018moleculenet}, for classification tasks, we use the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as the evaluation metric. For regression tasks, we use the root mean square error (RMSE) or the mean absolute error (MAE) for evaluation depending on the previous work. For datasets containing more than one task, we report the average scores across all tasks. Each task is independently run for 3 times with different random seeds, and the mean and standard derivation of the performances are reported. 

\noindent\textbf{Baselines} We compare our method with the following baselines:

\noindent(1) We compare \ourM{} with four methods without pre-training. Two of them are about applying Random Forest (RF) \citep{ho1995random} and Support Vector Machine (SVM) \citep{cortes1995support} to molecular fingerprints. The other two are GNN-based method, D-MPNN \citep{yang2019analyzing} and MGCNN \citep{lu2019molecular}, which are specifically designed for molecular property prediction. We also compare our model with previous pre-training methods, including \citet{hu2019strategies}, MolCLR~\citep{wang2021molclr}, GROVER \citep{rong2020self} and MPG \citep{li2020learn}.



\noindent(2) We train a standard Transformer and GNN using MLM only, which are denoted as TF (MLM) and GNN (MLM). TF (MLM) is an enhanced implementation of ChemBERTa~\cite{chithrananda2020chemberta}, where we train models with more GPUs and larger batch size, and eventually obtain better results (see Appendix \ref{appendix:chemberta} for more details). For GNN (MLM), we only mask the atoms randomly, without applying bond deletion and subgraph removal, which are left as future work. Also, we implement a variant of \ourM{}, ``\ourM{} w/o MLM'',  where we only use dual-view loss and do not use MLM.

\noindent(3) To investigate the effectiveness of using two heterogeneous models, we implement another variants, where the two branches are both Transformer or both GNNs. The MLM loss and dual-view consistency loss are both applied. We randomly choose one branch for finetuning. Denote these variants as TF () and GNN ().

\iffalse
\begin{enumerate}
\item Following \citet{wang2021molclr}, we first compare \ourM{} with four supervised learning methods. In the concrete, we compare with two shallow machine learning methods, Random Forest (RF) \citep{ho1995random} and Support Vector Machine (SVM) \citep{cortes1995support}, which take the molecular fingerprints as the input. We also compare with two graph neural network D-MPNN \citep{yang2019analyzing} and MGCNN \citep{lu2019molecular}, which are specifically designed for molecular property prediction.
\item We also compare our method with the following state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods: (i) \citet{hu2019strategies}, which consider both node-level and graph-level pre-training in combination with an expressive GNN. (ii) MolCLR \citep{wang2021molclr}, which
contrasts positive pairs against negative pairs with three graph augmentation strategies. (iii) GROVER \citep{rong2020self}, which integrates Message Passing Networks into the Transformer-style architecture and dedsign a series of self-supervised tasks in node-, edge- and graph-level. (iv) MPG \citep{li2020learn}, which propose a  powerful model and an effective self-supervised strategy for pre-training.
\item We train a standard Transformer or GNN using MLM only, denoted by TF or GNN w/ MLM. It is worth noting that we only mask the atom randomly, and do not use bond deletion and subgraph removal in GNN pre-training. 
\item We train \ourM{} using BYOL only, \emph{i.e.}, without masked language loss applied on Transformer and GNN, which is denoted by \ourM{} w/o MLM.
\item We also train two variants of \ourM{}, mutual learning between two Transformers or two GNNs respectively, which is denoted by \ourM{}-TF or GNN.

\noindent{\textbf{Results}} 
The results of the official test from DeepChem are shown in Table~\ref{tab:results_overall_molecular_property_prediction}, and those of the test sets from GROVER \cite{rong2020self} are in Table~\ref{tab:results_grover_mpg}. After pre-training with \ourM{}, denote the results finetuned from the Transformer branch and GNN branch as \ourMTF{} and \ourMGNN{} respectively. We have the following observations:


\noindent(1) Compared with the previous supervised methods, \ourMTF{} outperforms almost all previous baselines across different tasks, which leverage well-designed fingerprints or the specially designed GNNs. The results demonstrate  the effectiveness of using pre-trained models.


\noindent(2)  As shown in the second and third parts of Table~\ref{tab:results_overall_molecular_property_prediction}, both MLM loss and dual-view consistency loss help, no matter for the Transformer branch or GNN branch. Take the BBBP task of Transformer branch as an example. With MLM only or dual-view loss only, the accuracy is  and  respectively. After using both of them, the accuracy becomes . On the other hand, if we apply dual-view loss only, we find that in general, the results are slightly worse than using MLM only (see the row ``\ourMTF{} w/o MLM'').

\noindent(3) If we apply our method to two Transformer branches or two GNN branches (i.e., the ``TF ()'' and ``GNN ()'' in Table~\ref{tab:results_overall_molecular_property_prediction}), we can see the results is not good as our proposed \ourM{}, although we observe some improvement over using MLM only or dual-view consistency loss only. This is consistent with our discovery in Figure~\ref{fig:case_study_in_motivation}, where the Transformer and GNN have complementary views towards processing molecules.

\noindent(4) We empirically found that tuning on the Transformer branch is better than tuning on the GNN branch. Therefore, by default, we recommend using the Transformer branch. However, if we do not count for the number of parameters and use both branches for inference, the performances can be further improved (see the row ``\ourM{}''), but not too much.

\noindent(5) Compared with other pre-training methods, \citet{hu2019strategies} and MolCLR, which have more sophisticated models or training strategy, \ourMTF{} achieves the best performance on  out of  binary classification tasks. Also, compared with two recent models, GROVER and MPG,  \ourMTF{} also outperforms them on  classification and regression tasks (see Table \ref{tab:results_grover_mpg}). This shows that the joint pre-training of different views brings impressive benefit for molecular property prediction.

\noindent(6) We ensemble the TF (MLM) and GNN (MLM), where the two models are independently trained and finetuned, and their predictions are averaged. The results are denoted by the row ``TF (MLM) + GNN (MLM)''. Our method \ourMTF{} still significantly outperforms the ensemble baseline.
 
\noindent(7) Finally, we also pre-train on  compounds and then finetune on the downstream tasks. Compared to the results obtained by pre-training on  data, we observe improvement for both Transformer branch and GNN branch. We will explore how to effectively use more data in the future. 


We compare the training time and parameters of different models. The statistics are reported in Table~\ref{tab:summary_modelpram_time}. DMP takes slightly longer training time than TF (MLM), (3.8 days v.s. 2.5 days), but achieves significant improvement over previous baselines.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compared those supervised baseline, our methods xxx. It shows that with pre-training, the representation from standard Transformer can be better than fingerprint-based models and those model specifically designed for molecular property prediction. Since our method is architecture agnostic, we expect our method can be improved by adopting these domain-specific architecture into our method and leave it as our future work.
    \item In comparison with other self-supervised methods, our method achieved the best performance on 5 out of 6 binary classification tasks and all 3 regression tasks. Even though these baselines use specifically designed model architecture and/or more  sophisticated pre-training strategies, while our methods use the vanilla Transformer and DeeperGCN as the backbone and naive masked language modeling tasks as the training objective, our model still beat these model by a large margin. It is shown that the representation alignment of different views can bring a impressive benefit for molecule pre-training.
    \item Compared to DMP-GNN and DMP-Tf, we can see that even though these two variants have improved over the MLM baselines, they are also significantly lag behind the DMP with dual view loss. It demonstrates that the benefits of our method mainly come from the dual views rather then a two branch architecture.
    \item We also train our model without masked language modeling objective, i.e., only with dual view pre-training loss. It is shown that the dual view pre-training is comparable to pre-training GNN or Transformer with masked language modeling loss only.
    \item Comparing the different choices of branch, we can find that Transformer branch is a better choice than GNN branch for downstream tasks. Besides, the combination of two branch for downstream tasks can further improve the performance metric.

\subsection{Experiments on retrosynthesis}
In addition to molecule classification, we also conduct experiments on molecule generation. Specifically, we choose the retrosynthesis task: Given a target molecule (i.e., product) which cannot be directly obtained, we want to identify several easily obtained molecules (i.e., reactants) that can synthesize the product. 

\noindent{\bf Dataset}: Following~\citep{GLN,G2Gs,NEURIPS2020_819f46e5}, we conduct experiments on two widely used  datasets, USPTO-K \citep{liu2017retrosynthetic,coley2017computer} and USPTO-full \citep{GLN,NEURIPS2020_819f46e5}. USPTO-K consists of K reactions with 10 reaction types in total, and USPTO-full consists of K cleaned reactions from the USPTO 1976-2016 without reaction types. We use the data released by \cite{GLN}, where the training, validation and test has been split in advance and each part contains ,  and  of the total data respectively.
For USPTO-K, we work on two settings where the reaction type is given or not.

\noindent{\bf Network Architecture}: We explore both the Transformer branch and the GNN branch.



For the Transformer branch, we implement three models for comparison: (i) the standard Transformer. Both the encoder and decoder have  layers, with  attention heads, embedding dimension  and feed-forward dimension ; (ii) We use the pre-trained model to initialize the encoder while the decoder remains the same as (i); (iii) Following~\cite{zhu2020incorporating}, we fuse the pre-trained branch with Transformer, where each layer in the encoder and decoder attends to the output of pre-trained model in an attentive way. 

For the GNN branch, we combine our method with GLN~\citep{GLN}. Specifically, we replace the GNN modules (i.e., the  to  in \citep{GLN}) used in its released code (\url{https://github.com/Hanjun-Dai/GLN}) by our pre-trained GNN branch, while keep the remaining part unchanged. Denote this method as ``GLN w/ DMP''.  We also implement another variant of GLN, where the GNN modules are replaced with DeeperGCN~\citep{li2020deepergcn} so as to verify the effectiveness of pre-training. 









\noindent{\bf Evaluation Metrics}: We evaluate the models by the top- exact match accuracy (briefly, top- accuracy), which verifies that given a product, whether one of the  generated reactant sets exactly matches the ground truth reactant set, . For all , we use beam search to generate the reactant sets, and rank them by log likelihoods.

    \caption{Results of top- exact match accuracy on retrosynthesis (Transformer-based models).}
    \label{tab:retrosys}
\end{table}


\noindent{\bf Results of Transformer-based Models}: The results of the Transformer-based models are shown in Table \ref{tab:retrosys}. We first train the standard Transformer (denoted as ``Transformer''), which achieves  top-1 accuracy on the unknown type setting. After initializing the encoder with pre-trained model, we observe that the accuracy drops to . This is consistent with the discovery in \cite{zhu2020incorporating}, where simply applying initialization to sequence generation might not lead to good results. 

After using the method in \cite{zhu2020incorporating} (marked as \ourM{} fusion), we found that our model brings improvement to retrosynthesis. Specifically, on USPTO-50k dataset, we improve the top-1 accuracy from  to  when the reaction type is unknown, and from  to  when the type is given. On average, \ourM{} improves the standard Transformer by  points w.r.t. top- accuracy across all settings. Compared to a previous pre-trained model ChemBERTa~\cite{chithrananda2020chemberta} which is also used following~\cite{zhu2020incorporating}, our method outperforms it by  and  on the above two settings, which demonstrates the superiority of \ourM{} again. On the largest dataset, USPTO-full, our method also boosts the Transformer baseline by  points, setting a state-of-the-art results on USPTO-full. The comparisons of our method with previous methods are shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:retrosys}.

\noindent{\bf Results of GNN-based Models}: The results of combining the GNN branch and GLN are shown in Table~\ref{tab:retrosys_gnn}. By combing GNN with our method, we achieved state-of-the-art results on these two tasks, which demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-training. By comparing with GLN w/ DeeperGCN, we can conclude that the improvement is brought by pre-training instead of different GNN modules.

\caption{Visualization of the representations learned by different models. Different colors indicate different scaffolds.}
\label{fig:viz_different_models_by_scaffold}
\end{figure}
We visualize the pre-trained representations to verify whether they capture the scaffold information~\cite{hu2016scaffold}, which is used to represent the core structures of bioactive compounds. Intuitively, molecules with the same scaffold share similar architectures, and therefore are expected to be close in the high-level representation space. Following \cite{li2020learn}, we choose ten representative scaffolds (denoted as )\footnote{We show the ten scaffolds in Appendix \ref{appendix:scaffold}. } and then randomly select  compounds.
For each compound whose scaffold lies in , we obtain its three representations: one from GNN pre-training with MLM only, one from Transformer pre-training with MLM only, and the third one from the  Transformer branch of our \ourM{} pre-training. We visualize the features through t-SNE~\cite{van2008visualizing} and the results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:viz_different_models_by_scaffold}. We find that for the representations obtained by GNN pre-training and Transformer pre-training,   the molecules in different scaffolds  are overlapped and mixed together (e.g., the green and purple nodes for GNN; the green and light blue nodes for Transformer). In contrast, for the representations obtained by \ourM{} pre-training, the molecules in different scaffolds are well separated, which demonstrates that our \ourM{} better captures the scaffold information. Quantitatively, in terms of the DB index \citep{davies1979cluster} (the smaller, the better), which is a metric to evaluate the clustering results, \ourM{} clearly outperforms GNN pre-training and Transformer pre-training.












\section{Conclusions and future work}
In this work, we proposed \ourM{}, a novel molecule pre-training method that leverages dual views of molecules.
The core idea of \ourM{} is to maximize the consistency between the two representations extracted from two views, in addition to predicting masked tokens.
We achieve state-of-the-art results on seven molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and three retrosynthesis tasks. 
For future work, first, we will combine with stronger GNN models, e.g. \cite{rong2020self,li2020learn}. Second, as discussed in Section \ref{discussion_limitation}, it is interesting to design a pre-training method that dynamically determines which view to use for a specific molecule instead of going through both views, so as to improve training efficiency. Finally, compressing the pre-trained model is another interesting topic.

\section{Experiment Setup}
\subsection{Detailed configuration of the GNN branch}\label{appendix:deepergcn}
The GNN branch in \ourM{} is a variant of DeeperGCN \citep{li2020deepergcn}, which is stacked by 12 identical blocks. Each block consists of a batch normalization layer, a nonlinear layer and a graph convolutional layer sequentially, with a skip  connection connected the input and the output. In each graph convolutional layer, each node will fuse its neighbor edge representations and its neighbor node representations with an aggregation layer. Specifically, in \ourM{}, the aggregation layer is a concatenation of maximize, minimize and average pooling. 
\subsection{Finetuning hyperparameters}\label{appendix:finetuninghyperparaments}

We compare our method with ChemBERTa \citep{chithrananda2020chemberta} on two classification datasets, BBBP and HIV, which is also used in \citep{chithrananda2020chemberta}.
The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:comwithchemberta}, where TF (MLM) means that we pre-train a Transformer model using masked language modeling only, and \ourM{}TF means that we pre-train a Transformer using \ourM{}. TF (MLM) is an enhanced implementation of ChemBERTa, where we train models with more GPUs and larger batch size, and eventually obtain better results.
We can see that our proposed method  outperforms both ChemBERTa and TF (MLM), which shows the effectiveness of our method.
