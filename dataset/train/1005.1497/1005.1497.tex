\begin{abstract}
An exact, one-to-one transform is presented that not only allows digital circular convolutions, but is free from multiplications and quantisation errors for transform lengths of arbitrary powers of two. The transform is analogous to the \acl{DFT}, with the canonical harmonics replaced by a set of cyclic integers computed using only bit-shifts and additions modulo a prime number. The prime number may be selected to occupy contemporary word sizes or to be very large for cryptographic or data hiding applications. The transform is an extension of the \aclp{RT} via Carmichael's Theorem. These properties allow for exact convolutions that are impervious to numerical overflow and to utilise \acl{FFT} algorithms.

\acresetall \section{Introduction}\label{sec::Intro}
The \ac{DFT} is commonly used to compute the circular convolution  of two finite (or periodic) sequences  and  of length  as

by using the Convolution Theorem, where \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::CCP} can be computed simply as a product of both sequences in Discrete Fourier space. This theorem provides a computational advantage because the Cooley-Tukey algorithm~\citep{Cooley1965} for computing the \ac{DFT} has a computational complexity of , as opposed to  for direct methods, when  is a power of two.

A major result of this letter regarding convolutions can be summarised as follows. Let  denote computing the remainder with respect to  (see Appendix~\ref{sec::Sino} for details), where , i.e.  is an integer, and  is a prime number (or prime) as given in, but not restricted to, \tabTag~\ref{tab::Primes}. To compute the digital circular convolution of two finite integer sequences, one transforms both sequences as

which only involves bit-shifting, modulo and addition operations. The coefficients of these two sequences are multiplied and the result is inverted as

where . Note that the convolution is free from round-off errors as no floating-point numbers are required. Exact digital filtering involving division operations can be performed via multiplicative inverses, i.e. an integer  so that . The Cooley-Tukey algorithm~\citep{Cooley1965} is easily applied by replacing  with the powers of two , where  and . In other words, the  root of unity  is replaced with the integer-only equivalent . The transform lengths permitted are  when  that divide  in \tabTag~\ref{tab::Primes}. For example, the prime 13631489 allows for all  up to and including .

Equations~\eqref{eqn::NTT} and \eqref{eqn::iNTT} are an extension of the \acp{RT}~\citep{Agarwal1974}, which, until now, were only practical for small () transform lengths, severely limiting its applications~\citep{Agarwal1974a}. The theory developed in \secTag~\ref{sec::Carmichael} and~\ref{sec::Transforms} of this letter applies Carmichael's Theorem to remove these limitations completely by generalising the concept of an integer based  root of unity. \tabTag~\ref{tab::Primes} shows that the moduli  chosen for very large transform lengths  can fit into a 32-bit word size because the primes are shown to be any (including the smallest) one of the factors of large Fermat numbers, which are numbers of the form

\secTag~\ref{sec::Transforms} also presents a modulus free transform similar to \eqnsTag~\eqref{eqn::NTT} and \eqref{eqn::iNTT}, i.e. an integer-only transform without the need for modulo operations, using the same theory.

The preservation of the \ac{CCP}, which allows one to use the Convolution Theorem for finite sequences, is made possible because the unit circle of the \ac{DFT} (see \figTag~\ref{fig::Circles}(a)) is replaced with the digital ``circle''

so that  is a multiple of  (see \figsTag~\ref{fig::Circles}(c) and~\ref{fig::Congruence}). The successive powers  of two generates a unique set of integers in some order modulo . The result is a circle consisting of a set of cyclic integers, i.e. a set of unique integers with a period. These integers define the ``harmonics'' of the transform in \eqnsTag~\eqref{eqn::NTT} and \eqref{eqn::iNTT}. Integer coefficients allow computations to be done without round-off error or numerical overflow, since the results are congruent modulo ~\citep{Nussbaumer1978}.

The new transform is an extension of the \acp{RT}~\citep{Agarwal1974}, which consist of the \ac{FNT}~\citep{Schonhage1971} and the \ac{MNT}~\citep{Rader1972}. When using bit-shifts, the \ac{FNT} and the \ac{MNT} only utilise moduli 64-bits or less in size for small () transform lengths. The \ac{FNT} only allows larger transform lengths when not in bit-shift form, i.e. the sequence is multiplied by powers of integers other than two (such as three) in \eqnsTag~\eqref{eqn::NTT} and~\eqref{eqn::iNTT}. A solution is to use multi-dimensional techniques which provide a limited extension of the transform lengths~\citep{Agarwal1974a}. Pollard~\citep{Pollard1971} showed that these transforms may have an alternate form (that also does not utilise bit-shifting) via Euler's Theorem

where ,  and  are coprime and  is provided in Appendix~\ref{sec::Totient}. When  is prime, \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::Euler} becomes , which is known as Fermat's (little) Theorem. These alternate transforms also preserve the \ac{CCP} while allowing arbitrary transform lengths and are referred to as \acp{NTT}. The modulus  for these transforms are primes of the form  so that , allowing transform lengths of  and divisors of ~\citep{Bhattacharya2000}. On the rare occasions when computations explicitly require large exponents in \eqnsTag~\eqref{eqn::ChineseHypothesis} and~\eqref{eqn::Euler}, they can still be computed in logarithmic complexity using modular exponentiation methods.

The \acp{NTT} are ideal for real data but can also be complex-valued~\citep{Nussbaumer1976}. \acp{NTT} have been applied to fast multiplication of very large integers~\citep{Schonhage1971}, fast digital convolutions and filtering~\citep{Agarwal1974,Agarwal1974a}, encryption~\citep{Mohan1985} and discrete Radon transforms~\citep{Chandra2010c}. Agarwal and Burrus~\citep{Agarwal1974} showed the \ac{NTT} to be faster than the \ac{FFT} in their implementation. Chandra~\citep{Chandra2010c} (via the open-source library~\citep{Chandra2009b}) showed that a modern implementation of the \ac{NTT} outperforms the popular FFTW library.

\section{Carmichael's Theorem}\label{sec::Carmichael}
This section presents a new and more general theory of \acfp{NTT} utilising the concept of primitive roots from Carmichael's Theorem~\citep{Carmichael1910} (see Appendix~\ref{sec::Totient}), a generalisation of Euler's Theorem given in \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::Euler}. The primary result of this new theory are \eqnsTag~\eqref{eqn::NTT} and~\eqref{eqn::iNTT} when using \tabTag~\ref{tab::Primes}.

To construct an \ac{NTT}, one needs a set of unique cyclic integers sufficient to represent all the coefficients of a given transform length . In Euler's Theorem, the integer  is a special integer called a primitive root (or -root~\citep{Carmichael1910}) related to the modulus, where successive powers  of  generates all the integers  in some unique order modulo  (see \figTag~\ref{fig::Circles}(b)). This condition works well, but is very restrictive as not all integers are -roots of a given modulus and not all moduli have -roots. For example, the integer 2 is only a -root for primes of the form  when  itself is prime~\citep[pg. 102]{Beiler1966}. Thus, the integer 2 is only suitable for prime length \acp{NTT} and not a -root of primes of the form  required for power of two transform lengths in this theory.

Carmichael~\citep{Carmichael1910} developed the concept of the primitive -root, where the successive powers  of this root generates a fixed subset of the integers  in some unique order modulo  (see \figTag~\ref{fig::Circles}(c)). The number of integers in this subset is , where  is the smallest integer for which

is true. Thus, one gets a set of unique cyclic integers of order  capable of representing  distinct coefficients. Carmichael~\citep{Carmichael1910} points out the smallest composite (non-prime) modulus  for when this and \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::ChineseHypothesis} is true is . Since  and , then  as . Such composite moduli are now known as Poulet numbers. To construct a unique and sufficient set of coefficients for power of two transform lengths, one needs to show that  and find a modulus  so that 2 is a -root of .

\section{New Transforms}\label{sec::Transforms}
This section presents the proof of the transform stated in \eqnsTag~\eqref{eqn::NTT} and~\eqref{eqn::iNTT}. It will be shown that the primes in \tabTag~\ref{tab::Primes} for this transform can be chosen to be any (including the smallest) prime factor of the Fermat numbers~\eqref{eqn::FermatNumbers}. The section will conclude with a discussion of another useful result.

\subsection{Multiplication Free}
In order to satisfy \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::ChineseHypothesis}, a prime modulus must be selected so that

i.e.  is a prime factor of , when the transform length  is a power of two. The modulus is chosen to be prime so that one may divide the coefficients by any integer, allowing the construction of arbitrary exact filters. The value  must be the smallest multiple of  to the base 2 so that 2 is a -root of  as given by~\eqref{eqn::LambdaRoot} and \secTag~\ref{sec::Carmichael}.

The numbers of the form , which will be denoted as the Rader numbers, are a specific form of the Mersenne numbers

Mersenne numbers can always be expressed as

when  is composite, since they are binomial numbers~\citep[pg. 42]{Schumer2004}. Applying this expansion to the Rader numbers 

and so on until one arrives at an identity of the Fermat numbers~\citep[pg. 26]{Krizek2001}

For example, the first several factorisations of  are

\eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::Identity} suggests that  should be a Fermat number, noting that only the first five Fermat numbers are known to be prime.
\begin{theorem}[Fermat Number Moduli]\label{thm::FermatModuli}
The smallest power of two  in \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::LambdaRoot} for which

is true, is when the modulus  is the Fermat number .
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By the identity~\eqref{eqn::Identity}, higher order Fermat numbers can only become a factor of a given Rader number as  increases. Multiples of these higher order Fermat numbers cannot exist as factors of Mersenne numbers  less than the given Rader number since the only divisor of  is two and powers of two by \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::Binomial}, i.e.  cannot be any number other than the divisors of . Hence by \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::Identity},  is the smallest multiple of  to the base 2 so .
\end{proof}
This results in a reformulation of the \ac{FNT}, which is only suitable for small transform lengths as the Fermat numbers grow large rapidly and are composite after . Can one extend the above theorem to include the prime factors of large Fermat numbers? The answer is yes and it is the main theoretical result of this letter.
\begin{theorem}[Fermat Factor Moduli]\label{thm::FactorModuli}
The smallest power of two  for which \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::Rader} is true, is when the modulus  is a factor  (prime or otherwise) of the Fermat number .
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume the contrary, that there exists a Mersenne number  less than a given Rader number that is also a multiple of . From \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::Binomial}, , but the only divisors of  is two or its powers. Now it is well known that the Fermat numbers do not share any common factor with each other, i.e. they are pair-wise coprime~\citep[pg. 63]{Schumer2004}. Hence,  cannot be a power of two less than  and so the first multiple of  must be the Rader number. Thus, for ,  or  allows for  when , since neither prime divides  for all .
\end{proof}
We denote  as a Rader prime when  is prime. Some useful Rader primes are given in \tabTag~\ref{tab::Primes}, resulting in the transforms given in \eqnsTag~\eqref{eqn::NTT} and~\eqref{eqn::iNTT}. This is a far more useful result than \propTag~\ref{thm::FermatModuli} as now the moduli may be small or as large as desired, by simply selecting a Fermat number with a suitable small or large Rader prime. Although the factorisation of Fermat numbers is still an active area of research~\citep{Brent1996}, there are sufficient numbers of factors already known to accommodate any word size or for data hiding via large moduli.

Applying the Generalised Fermat and Mersenne Numbers to \propTag~\ref{thm::FactorModuli} should extend the \ac{NTT} of Dimitrov \emph{et al.}~\citep{Dimitrov1994}. Euler~\citep{Euler1732} showed that all prime factors of the Fermat numbers are of the form , so \propTag~\ref{thm::FactorModuli} should also extend the work of Bhattacharya and Astola~\citep{Bhattacharya2000}. Finally, hardware implementations of this new transform may be similar to those constructed by McClellan~\citep{McClellan1976} and Leibowitz~\citep{Leibowitz1976} for the \ac{FNT}, since both require simple bit-shifting and prime factors of the Fermat numbers are of the form ~\citep{Euler1732}. See Agarwal and Burrus~\citep[\secTag VI.E]{Agarwal1974} for examples of how to compute the bit-shifting. The next section introduces an integer-only transform not requiring modulus operations.


\subsection{Modulus Free}
Carmichael~\citep{Carmichael1910} also proves the useful result

where  and 2 are coprime (see Appendix~\ref{sec::Totient}). This result can be used in constructing transforms that preserve the \ac{CCP}, while requiring no modulo operations in programming languages (such as ) or architectures that support ``wrap around'' upon overflow, i.e. the act of truncation is equivalent to modulo power of two (see \figTag~\ref{fig::Circles}(d)). This is advantageous because the integer division instruction, a critical part of the modulo operation, is generally a slow instruction. Note that an expression like \eqnTag~\eqref{eqn::Dyadic} is not possible using Euler's Theorem~\citep{Carmichael1910}.

Normalisation of the transform is also a concern, since the multiplicative inverse does not exist. This can be resolved by ensuring  is sufficiently large so that unnormalised values do not exceed . In other words, if  is the bit depth of the data, then . 

The implementations of these transforms can be found in the NTTW C library~\citep{Chandra2009b}. Applications and performance comparisons of the various \acp{NTT}, as well as to the \ac{DFT}, will be part of a future publication.

\section*{Conclusion}\label{sec::Conclusion}
Transforms for fast digital convolutions were constructed that did not either require any multiplications or modulo operations (see \eqnsTag~\eqref{eqn::NTT},~\eqref{eqn::iNTT}, \tabTag~\ref{tab::Primes} and~\eqref{eqn::Dyadic}). The former utilises only bit-shifts, additions and modulo operations on prime factors of the Fermat numbers (denoted as Rader primes), while the latter only uses multiplications and additions. The result was made possible by using Carmichael's generalisation of Euler's Theorem, which also provides a more general theory of \aclp{NTT}.
