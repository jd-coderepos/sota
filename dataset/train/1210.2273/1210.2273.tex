\subsection{Bisimilarity
of pOCA is in PSPACE}\label{sec:bispOCAinPSPACE}

The bisimilarity problem for (non-probabilistic)
one-counter automata is  PSPACE-complete, as shown
in~\cite{BGJ:Concur10}. It turns out that for pOCA we get
PSPACE-completeness as well.
The lower bound is shown in Section~\ref{sec-lower-bounds}; here
we show:

\begin{theorem} \label{thm-bisim-pOCA-inPspace}
The bisimilarity problem for pOCA is in PSPACE, even
if we present the instance
 $\Delta=(Q,\{Z,X\},\Sigma,\mathord{\btran{}})$,
$p X^mZ, q X^nZ$ (for which we ask if $p X^mZ\sim q X^nZ$)
by a shorthand using $m,n$ written in binary.
\end{theorem}
The reduction underlying
Theorem~\ref{thm:prob-to-nondet} would only provide an
exponential-space upper bound, so
we give a pOCA-specific polynomial-space algorithm.
In fact, we adapt the algorithm from~\cite{BGJ:Concur10};
the principles are the same but some
ingredients have to be slightly modified.
The following text is meant to give the idea in a self-contained
manner, though at a more abstract
level than in~\cite{BGJ:Concur10}.
The main difference is in the notion of local consistency, discussed
around Proposition~\ref{prop:localconsistency}.

Similarly as~\cite{BGJ:Concur10},
we use a geometrical presentation of relations on
the set of configurations (Fig.~\ref{fig:belts} reflects such a
presentation).
A relation can be identified with
a $1$/$0$ (or YES/NO)
colouring of the ``grid''  $\N\times\N\times (Q\times Q)$:

\begin{definition}
For a
relation $R$ on $Q\times (\{X\}^*Z)$,
by the  \emph{(characteristic) colouring} $\chi_R$ we mean
the function
$\chi_R:\N\times\N\times (Q\times Q)\rightarrow \{1,0\}$
where $\chi_R(m,n,(p,q))=1$ if and only if $(pX^mZ,qX^nZ)\in R$.
Given (a colouring)
$\chi:\N\times\N\times (Q\times Q)\rightarrow\{1,0\}$, by
$R_{\chi}$ we denote the relation
$R_{\chi}=\{(pX^mZ,qX^nZ)\mid \chi(m,n,(p,q))=1\}$.
\end{definition}
The algorithm uses the fact that $\chi_{\sim}$ is ``regular'', i.e.
$\{(m,n,(p,q))\mid p X^mZ\sim qX^nZ\}$ is a (special) semilinear set.
More concretely, there are polynomials $pol_1, pol_2: \N\rightarrow\N$
(independent of the pOCA~$\Delta$) such that the following partition of the grid
$\N\times\N\times (Q\times Q)$
(sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig:belts})
has an important property specified later.
If $Q=\{q_1,q_2,\dots,q_k\}$, hence $|Q|=k$, then the grid is
partitioned into three parts: the \emph{initial-space}, i.e.
$\{(m,n,(p,q))\mid m,n\leq pol_2(k)\}$, the \emph{belt-space},
which is given by at most $k^4$ linear belts, with the slopes $\frac{c}{d}$ where
$c,d\in\{1,2,\dots,k^2\}$ and with the (vertical) thickness bounded by
$pol_1(k)$, and the rest, called the \emph{background}.
Moreover, $pol_2(k)$ is sufficiently large w.r.t. $pol_1(k)$, so that
 the belts are separated by the background
 outside
the initial space.

The mentioned important property is that
there is a period $\psi$, given by an exponential function of $k$,
such that
if two points $(m,n,(p,q))$ and $(m+i\psi,n+j\psi,(p,q))$
(for $i,j\in\N$)
are both in the background, for both $m,n$ larger then a polynomial bound, then
$\chi_{\sim}$ has the same value for both these points; in other words,
$\chi_{\sim}$ colours the background periodically.
Another important ingredient is the locality of the bisimulation conditions,
resulting from the fact that the counter value can change by at most $1$
per step.

To explain the ``grid-partition'', we start with
 considering the finite automaton $\F_{\Delta}$
underlying $\Delta$;
$\F_{\Delta}$ behaves like $\Delta$ ``pretending'' that the
counter is always positive.





\begin{definition}\label{D underlying}
For a pOCA
$\Delta=(Q,\{Z,X\},\Sigma,\mathord{\btran{}})$,
in the {\em underlying finite pLTS}
$\F_\Delta=(Q,\Sigma,\tran{})$ we have
a transition $p\tran{a}d'$ if and only if there is a transition $pX\btran{a}d$
such that $d'(q)=d(q,\varepsilon)+d(q,X)+d(q,XX)$ (for all
$q\in Q$).
\end{definition}
Using standard partition-refinement arguments, we observe
that $\sim_{k-1}=\sim_k=\sim$ on $\F_{\Delta}$ when $k=|Q|$.
For configurations of~$\Delta$ we now define the distance
$\distINC$ to the set of configurations which are
``INCompatible'' with $\F_{\Delta}$.
\begin{definition}
Assuming a pOCA
$\Delta=(Q,\{Z,X\},\Sigma,\btran{})$, where $|Q|=k$,
\\
we define $\INC\subseteq Q\times (\{X\}^* Z)$ and
$\distINC:Q\times  (\{X\}^* Z) \rightarrow\N\cup\{\infty\}$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\INC=\{pX^mZ\mid \forall q\in Q:pX^mZ\not\sim_k  q\}$ (where $q$
is a state in $\F_{\Delta}$),
\item
$\distINC(pX^mZ)=\min\,\{\,\ell\mid\exists q\gamma\in\INC:
pX^mZ(\btran{})^\ell q\gamma \,\}$\,;
we set $\min\,\emptyset\,=\infty$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Since $pX^mZ\sim_m p$ (by induction on $m$), and thus
$pX^mZ\in\INC$ implies
$m<k$,
we can surely construct $\INC$ for a given pOCA in polynomial space.


\begin{proposition}
\label{L nonreachable}
\hfill
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $pX^mZ\sim qX^nZ$ then $\distINC(pX^mZ)=\distINC(qX^nZ)$.
\item
\mbox{If $\distINC(pX^mZ)=\distINC(qX^nZ)=\infty$
then
$pX^mZ\sim qX^nZ$ iff $pX^mZ\sim_k qX^nZ$.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
The proof is the same as in the non-probabilistic case.
(Point 1 is obvious. For Point 2 we verify that the set
$\{\,(q_1X^{n_1}Z,q_2X^{n_2}Z)\mid q_1X^{n_1}Z\sim_k
q_2X^{n_2}Z\text{ and } \distINC(q_1X^{n_1}Z) = \distINC(q_2X^{n_2}Z) = \infty$
is a bisimulation.)

Consider a shortest path from $pX^{m}Z$ to $\INC$ (for large $m$).
It is not hard to prove (as in~\cite[Lemma 10]{BGJ:Concur10}) that such a path can be based on iterating
a simple counter-decreasing cycle (of length
$\leq k$), possibly preceded by a polynomial prefix and followed by a
polynomial suffix.
So (finite) $\distINC(pX^{m}Z)$ can be always expressed
by the use of linear functions $\frac{\ell}{e}m+b$ where
$\ell, e\leq k$ are the length and the decreasing effect of a simple
cycle and $b$ is bounded by a polynomial in $k$.
It follows that if we have $\distINC(pX^{m}Z)=\distINC(qX^{n}Z)<\infty$,
then $n=\frac{\ell_1e_2}{e_1\ell_2}m+b'$,
which shows that
$(m,n,(p,q))$ lies in one of the above mentioned belts, or in the
initial space when $m,n$ are small.



As a consequence, in the background points $(m,n,(p,q))$
we have either $\distINC(pX^{m}Z)=\distINC(qX^{n}Z)=\infty$,
and $\chi_{\sim}(m,n,(p,q))=1$ if and only if $pX^{m}Z\sim_k qX^{n}Z$,
or $\distINC(pX^{m}Z)\neq\distINC(qX^{n}Z)$
(and thus  $\chi_{\sim}(m,n,(p,q))=0$).
So we can easily compute $\chi_{\sim}$ for any background point in
polynomial space.

The above mentioned shortest paths to $\INC$ also show that
if we choose $\psi=k!$ (so $\psi=O(2^{k\log k})$) then
we have
$pX^{m}Z\tran{}^* \INC$ if and only if $pX^{(m+\psi)}Z\tran{}^*\INC$ (for $m$ larger than
some polynomial bound), since the counter-effect of each simple cycle
divides $\psi$.
Hence
$\psi$ is a background period as mentioned above.

A nondeterministic algorithm, verifying that $p_0X^{m_0}Z\sim
q_0X^{n_0}Z$ for  $(m_0,n_0,(p_0,q_0))$ in the initial or belt-space,
is based on ``moving a
vertical window of width $3$'' (as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:belts});
in each phase, the window is moved by $1$ (to the right),
its intersection with the initial and belt space
(containing polynomially many
points) is computed, a colouring
on this intersection is guessed
 ($\chi_{\sim}$ is intended)
and its (local) consistency is
checked (for which also $\chi_{\sim}$
on the neighbouring background points is computed).
More precisely, in the first, i.e. leftmost, window position a
colouring in all
three (vertical) slices is guessed and the local consistency in the first two
slices is checked; after any later shift of the window
by one to the right, a colouring in
the new (the rightmost) slice is
guessed (the guesses in the previous two slices being remembered), and
the consistency in the current middle slice is checked.
If this is successfully performed
for exponentially many steps,
after $(m_0,n_0,(p_0,q_0))$ has been coloured with $1$, then
it is guaranteed that
the algorithm could successfully run forever; the pigeonhole principle
induces that each belt could be periodically coloured, with an
exponential period compatible with the period of the background-border
of the belt.
Such a successful run of the algorithm, exponential in time but
obviously only
polynomial in the required space, is thus a witness of $p_0X^{m_0}Z\sim
q_0X^{n_0}Z$. Since PSPACE=NPSPACE, we have thus sketched a proof
 of Theorem~\ref{thm-bisim-pOCA-inPspace}.




It remains to define precisely the consistency of a colouring,
guaranteeing that a successful run of the algorithm really witnesses
$p_0X^{m_0}Z\sim q_0X^{n_0}Z$. (As already mentioned, this is the main
change wrt~\cite{BGJ:Concur10}.)
We use the following particular variant of
characterizing (probabilistic) bisimilarity.
Given a pLTS
$(S,\Sigma,\tran{})$,
we say that $(s,t)$ is \emph{consistent w.r.t.}
a relation $R$ on $S$ (not necessarily an equivalence)
if
for each $s\tran{a}d$ there is  $t\tran{a}d'$,
and conversely for each $t\tran{a}d'$ there is  $s\tran{a}d$,
such that $d, d'$ are $R'$-equivalent where
$R'$
is the least equivalence containing the set
$\{(s',t')\mid s\tran{}s', t\tran{}t', (s',t')\in R\}$.
A \emph{relation} $R$ is \emph{consistent} if each $(s,t)\in R$ is consistent w.r.t.
$R$. The following proposition can be verified along the standard
lines.


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:localconsistency}
$\sim$ is consistent.
If $R$ is consistent then $R\subseteq \mathord{\sim}$.
\end{proposition}
Our algorithm can surely (locally) check the above defined
consistency of the
constructed $\chi$
(i.e. of $R_{\chi}$).
