\begin{abstract}

The problem of finding an optimal vertex cover in a graph is a classic NP-complete problem, and is a special case of the hitting set question. On the other hand, 
the hitting set problem, when asked in the context of induced geometric objects, often turns out to be exactly the vertex cover problem on restricted classes of graphs. In this work we explore a particular instance of 
such a phenomenon. We consider the problem of hitting all axis-parallel slabs induced by a point set , and show that it is equivalent to the problem of finding a vertex cover on a graph whose edge 
set is the union of two Hamiltonian Paths. We show the latter problem to be \NPC{}, and we also give an algorithm to find a vertex cover of size at most , on graphs of maximum degree four, whose running time is .

\section{Introduction}

Let  be a set of  points in  and let  be the family of all distinct objects of a particular kind
(disks, rectangles, triangles, \dots), such that each object in  has a distinct tuple of points from  on
its boundary. For example,  could be the family of  axis parallel rectangles such that each rectangle has a
distinct pair of points of  as its diagonal corners.  is called the set of all objects induced (spanned) by .

Various questions related to geometric objects induced by a point set have been studied in the last few decades.
A classical result in discrete geometry is the {\em First Selection Lemma}~\cite{BF84} which shows that there exists a point that is present in a constant fraction of triangles induced by . Another interesting question is to compute the minimum set of points in  that ``hits'' all
the induced objects in . This is a special case of the classical Hitting Set problem, which we will refer to as {\em Hitting Set for Induced Objects}.

For most geometric objects, it is not known if the {\em Hitting Set for induced objects} problem
is polynomially solvable. It is known to be polynomial solvable for skyline rectangles and halfspaces.
Recently, Rajgopal et al~\cite{RAGKM13} showed that this problem is NP-complete for lines.

The problem of finding an optimal vertex cover in a graph is a classic NP-complete problem, and is a special case of the Hitting Set problem. 
On the other hand, the hitting set for induced objects problem often turns out to be exactly the vertex cover problem, even on
restricted classes of graphs. For example, the problem of hitting set for induced axis-parallel rectangles is equivalent to the vertex cover on the Delaunay graph of the point set with respect to axis-parallel rectangles.

We study a particular phenomenon of this type, where the hitting set question in the geometric setting boils down to a vertex cover problem on a structured graph
class. We consider the problem of hitting set for induced axis-parallel slabs (rectangles whose horizontal or vertical sides are unbounded). Note that
this is even more structured than general axis-parallel rectangles, and indeed, it turns out that the corresponding Delaunay graph has a very special property --- its edge set
is the union of two Hamiltonian paths. Since any hitting set for the class of axis-parallel slabs induced by a point set  is exactly the vertex cover of the Delaunay graph
with respect to axis-parallel slabs for , our problem reduces to solving vertex cover on the class of graphs whose edge set is simply the union of two Hamiltonian Paths.


Despite the appealing structure, we show that -- surprisingly -- deciding  -vertex cover on this class of graphs is \NPC{}. This involves a rather intricate reduction from the problem of
finding a vertex cover on cubic graphs. We also appeal to the fact that the edge set of four-regular graphs can be partitioned into two two-factors, and the main challenge in the
reduction involves stitching the components of the two-factors into two Hamiltonian paths while preserving the size of the vertex cover in an appropriate manner.

Having established the NP-hardness of the problem, we pursue the question of improved fixed-parameter algorithms on this special case. Vertex Cover is one of the most well-studied
problems in the context of fixed-parameter algorithm design, it enjoys a long list of improvements even on special graph classes. We note that for {\sc Vertex Cover}, the
goal is to find a vertex cover of size at most  in time , and the ``race'' involves exploring algorithms that reduce the value of the best known constant .

In particular, even for sub-cubic graphs (where the maximum degree is at most three, and the problem remains \NPC{}), Xiao~\cite{X10} proposed an
algorithm with running time , improving on the previous best record ~\cite{Chen:2005:LST:1108358.1108360} of  by Chen, Kanj and Xia, and prior
to this, Razgon~\cite{R09} had a . The best-known algorithm for Vertex Cover~\cite{CKX10} on general graphs has a running time of  and uses polynomial-space.


Typically, these algorithms involve extensive case analysis on a cleverly designed search tree. In the second part of this work, we propose a branching algorithm with running time  for graphs with maximum degree bounded by at most four. This improves the best known algorithm for this class, which surprisingly has been no better than the algorithm for general graphs. We note that this implies faster algorithms for the case of graphs that can be decomposed into the union of two Hamiltonian Paths (since they have maximum degree at most four), however, whether they admit additional structure that can be exploited for even better algorithms remains an open direction.





\section{Preliminaries}

In this section, we state some basic definitions and introduce terminology from graph theory and algorithms. We also establish some of the notation that will be used throughout. 

We denote the set of natural numbers by  and set of real numbers by  . 
For a natural number , we use  to denote the set . For a finite set  we denote by  the set of all permutations of the elements of set . To describe the running times of our algorithms, we will use the  notation. Given , we define  to be , where  is some polynomial
function. That is, the  notation suppresses polynomial
factors in the running-time expression. 



\paragraph{Graphs.} In the following, let  be a graph. For any non-empty subset , the subgraph of  induced
by  is denoted by ; its vertex set is  and its edge set consists of all those edges of  with both endpoints in .
For , by  we denote the graph obtained by deleting the vertices in  and all edges which are incident to at least one vertex in .

A \emph{vertex cover} is a subset of vertices  such that  has no edges. We denote a vertex cover of size at most  of a graph 
 by . For  we denote the open-neighborhood of  by ,
closed-neighborhood of  by , second-open neighborhood by  s.t. 
second-closed neighborhood by .

When we are discussing a pair of vertices , then the common neighborhood of  and  is the set of vertices that are adjacent to both  and . 
In this context, a vertex  is called a \emph{private neighbor} of  if  is an edge and  is not an edge. We denote the degree of a vertex  by .

A \emph{path} in a graph is a sequence of distinct vertices  such that  is an edge for all .
A \emph{Hamiltonian path} of a graph  is a path featuring every vertex of . The following class of graphs will be of special interest to us.

\begin{definition}[\Braid{} graphs]
A graph  on the vertex set  is a \braid{} graph if the edges of the graph can be covered by two Hamiltonian paths. In other words, there exist permutations ,  of the vertex set for 
which  
\end{definition}



{\em Induced axis-parallel slabs}: Axis-parallel slabs are a special class
of axis-parallel rectangles where two horizontal or two vertical sides are
unbounded. Each pair of points  and  induces two
axis-parallel slabs of the form  and
. Let  represent the
family of  axis-parallel slabs induced by .





We refer the reader to \cite{graphbook} for details on standard graph theoretic notation and terminology we use in the paper. 

\paragraph{Parameterized Complexity.} A parameterized problem  is a subset of , where  is a finite alphabet. An instance of a
parameterized problem is a tuple , where  is a classical problem instance, 
and  is called the parameter. A central notion in parameterized complexity is {\em
  fixed-parameter tractability (FPT)} which means, for a given
instance , decidability in time , where
 is an arbitrary function of  and  is a polynomial in the
input size. 



 



\section{Hitting Set for Induced Axis-Parallel Slabs}

We show here that the problem of finding a hitting set of size at most  for the family of all axis-parallel slabs induced by a point set is equivalent to the problem of 
finding a vertex cover of a graph whose edges can be partitioned into two Hamiltonian Paths. In subsequent sections, we establish the NP-hardness of the latter problem, and also provide better FPT algorithms. Due the equivalence of these problems, we note that both the hardness and the algorithmic results apply to the problem of finding a hitting set for induced axis parallel slabs. 

\begin{lemma}
An instance of -vertex cover in a \braid{} graph  with permutations  can be reduced to the problem of finding a hitting set for the collection of all axis-parallel slabs induced 
by a point set. 
\label{dgapstohp}
d\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Sketch] Given an instance of Vertex Cover on a braid graph  with permutations  and , we create  points in  in an -grid as follows. We assume, by renaming if necessary, that  is the identity permutation. For every , we let . Since we only need to hit empty vertical and horizontal slabs, in the induced setting this amounts to hitting all consecutive slabs in the horizontal and vertical directions. It is easy to check that a hitting set for such slabs would exactly correspond to a vertex cover of . \qed
\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}
The problem of finding a hitting set for all induced axis-parallel slabs by a point set  can be reduced to the problem of finding a Vertex Cover in a \braid{} graph. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}From the given point set , we sort the points in  according to their -coordinates to obtain a permutation of the point set . Similarly, we sort with respect to -coordinate to get a permutation 
. Note that there exists a empty axis-parallel slab between two points if and only if they are adjacent with respect to at least one of the - or -coordinates, These are, on the other
hand, precisely the edges in the braid graph with  and  as the permutations, which shows the equivalence. 
\qed
\end{proof}


\section{NP-completenes of Vertex Cover on \Braid{}s}


In this section, we show that the problem of determining a vertex cover on the class of \braid{}s is hard even when the permutations of the \braid{} are given as input. 

The intuition for the hardness is the following. Consider a four-regular graph. By a theorem of Peterson, we know that the edges of such a graph can be partitioned into two sets, each of which would
be a two-factor in the graph . In other words, every four-regular graph can be thought of as a union of two collections of disjoint cycles, defined on same vertex set. It is conceivable
that these cycles can be patched together into paths, leading us to a braid graph. As it turns out, for such a patching, we need to have some control over the cycles in the decomposition to begin with. 
So we start with an instance of Vertex Cover on a cubic 2-connected planar graphs, morph such an instance to a four-regular graph while keeping track of a special cycle decomposition, which 
we later exploit for the ``stitching'' of cycles into Hamiltonian paths. 

Formally, therefore, the proof is by a reduction from Vertex Cover on a cubic 2-connected planar graph to an instance of -vertex cover on a \braid{} graph, noting that~\cite{Mohar2001102} shows the NP-hardness of 
Vertex Cover for cubic planar 2-connected graphs. We describe the construction in two stages, first showing the transformation to a four-regular graph and then proceeding to illustrate the transformation to a braid graph. 

\shortversion{

Due to space constraints, we only provide the highlights of the reduction. One of the main tasks is to merge the cycles in each decomposition. Let us first illustrate a gadget that combines two cycles into a 
longer one.\footnote{At this point, we are not concerned that this is leading us to, eventually, a Hamiltonian cycle rather than a path, because it is quite easy to convert the former to the latter.} Note that the gadget
itself must be a braid, and of course, we need to ensure equivalence. 

For the purpose of this brief discussion, our starting point is a four-regular graph . Recall that the edge set of  can be decomposed into two collections of cycles. Note that every 
vertex  participates in two cycles, say  and  --- these would be cycles from different collections. Now let the neighbors of  in  be , and let the neighbors in  be  and .

\caption{Stitching together one pair of cycles with a common vertex }.
\label{fig:W}
\end{figure}

We are now ready to describe the gadget . This gadget has four entry points, namely , and . The gadget is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:W}. It is easy to check that the gadget induces
a braid. Now, in , to insert this gadget, we remove  from , and make  adjacent to  and  adjacent to . Let us denote this graph by . Note that there is a path 
from  to  along the cycle  and there is a path from  to  along the cycle . 

For equivalence, we need to be sure that if even one of  is not picked in a vertex cover of , then we have enough room for the vertex  
in the reverse direction. To this end, we show the following crucial property of the gadget .

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:basic_correctness}
Let  be any vertex cover of . If one of  or  belongs to , then . On the other hand, there exists a vertex cover   of , that contains neither  nor , for which . 
\label{W1vc}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The vertices , , ,  form triangles, and  is an edge disjoint from these triangles. 
Therefore, we clearly require minimum of 9 vertices to cover edges of  alone. If we have  then we can cover all edges of  with 9 vertices. 
This proves the second part of the claim. 

Now, let  be a vertex cover such that . Then, apart from the 's present we have an edge , so including  we need at least 10 vertices. 
An analogous argument holds when  is present (edge  left).
If we have  then we can cover all edges of  with 10 vertices.
\qed
\end{proof}



\begin{corollary}We have a vertex cover of size  in  if and only if  admits a vertex cover of size . 
\end{corollary}


\begin{proof}
Let  be a vertex cover of . If , then . Therefore, we may cover the edges of  using the vertices  since 
there is no external obligation to pick either  or , and this would be an extension of  with at most nine additional vertices. If , then let . We extend  by 
the set , which also adds up to . In the reverse direction, given a vertex cover of size , we know that at least nine vertices of  are from .  
Let  denote the remaining vertices of . If all of , then note that  is a vertex cover of size  for . If one of , 
then  is a vertex cover of size at most  in . The size bound comes from Lemma~\ref{lem:basic_correctness} and the fact that either  or  
belongs to  due to the case we are considering. 
\end{proof}



We should be able to use this gadget repeatedly to stitch all cycles into two single long cycles. However, the iterative process involves several challenges. For instance, if some gadgets are already inserted, 
the paths along the cycles that we had before may not be so readily available. Also, while the process of breaking the cycle at a vertex  is clear, it is not obvious as to how one would mimic this 
construction for a neighbor of  after  has been suitably replaced. The concern here is that a straightforward application of the gadget will cause vertices from two different gadgets
to become adjacent, which we would like to avoid if we are to maintain the braid structure of the gadget itself. 

To address the former problem we create a slightly different gadget that creates artificial paths that can be used if the original cycle is broken by some previously inserted gadget. 
For the second problem, we start our reduction from cubic graphs and proceed in a manner so as to ensure that the cycle decompositions of the reduced graph are somewhat special. This allows us to choose mutually non-adjacent breakpoints .

Finally, these gadgets must be tied together into a path, which we organize with the help of connection gadgets. The reader is referred to the full version of this work for the complete details. 

\begin{theorem}
The problem of finding a vertex cover of size at most  in a braid graph is \NPC{}.

\longversion{

\paragraph{Transforming -connected cubic planar graphs to -regular graphs.}  Consider an instance of vertex cover on a cubic -connected planar graph , where . We transform this graph to a four-regular graph in two steps. This transformation is important because for turning a four-regular graph into a union of two Hamiltonian paths, we need the underlying decomposition into two-factors to have certain properties, which we will ensure in the first half of the reduction. 

The transformation from cubic graphs to four-regular graphs happens in two stages. First, we replace certain edges with gadgets that only serve to elongate certain paths in the graph. This is a technical artifact that will be useful later. Next, we add gadgets that increase the degree of every vertex so as to obtain a four-regular graph. 

\sloppypar
We begin by making two copies of , say,  and . Here, we let ,

\end{figure}

It is shown in ~\cite{Chudnovsky08perfectmatchings} that a planar cubic graph with no cut edge has exponentially many perfect matchings. Since we have a 2-connected cubic planar graph, there are evidently no cut edges. Therefore, we compute a perfect matching 
of  by the algorithm given in ~\cite{4567800}. Let the corresponding matching of  be .



For  we now describe how to construct  from . We use gadget  shown in Figure \ref{J}, where subscript  corresponds to graph  and edge . In Lemma ~\ref{VCJ}
we show the minimum number of vertices required to cover edges in  based on whether  are picked in the vertex cover or not. We define the sequence
, notice that this is a path in  and we also have the sequence , which is a cycle in . It is easy to see that all edges in  is either in the path  or on the cycle . We will refer to these sequences later, when we are specifying how the reduced graph is an union of two Hamiltonian paths. 


To construct  we initially set .
Fix the matching . We are going to replace every edge in this matching with the gadget . More formally, we have:
 

and  



We first have the following observation.



\begin{lemma}
Consider the graph  described above. Let  be an optimal vertex cover, and let  denote . If  includes at least one of , then , else .
\label{VCJ}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The vertices  induced a , therefore any vertex cover includes at least 3 vertices among them. The following cases arise depending on whether  is included in  or not.
\begin{itemize}
 \item [case 1] If  then we are forced to include  in . So we need at least give vertices in  and note that  is a set of five vertices that covers all edges in .
 \item [case 2] Suppose  picks exactly one of  and . In particular, let's say that , then we have . Therefore, we need at least four vertices in . Note also that  is a set of four vertices that covers all edges in .
 \item [case 3]  Finally, let . Since , at least one of  should be in . The rest of the argument is analogous to the previous case.
\end{itemize}
\qed
\end{proof}


In the next Lemma, we establish the relation between the vertex cover of  and vertex cover of .

\begin{lemma}
For , the graph  admits a vertex cover of size  if, and only if, the graph  has a vertex cover of size .
\label{pvcGin4}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
In the forward direction, consider a vertex cover  of . Note that for every matching edge , . So for each  corresponding to  we need exactly four more vertices to cover  by Lemma~\ref{VCJ}. But , so  vertices are sufficient to cover .

In the reverse direction, let  be a vertex cover of size  for , and let . Then  covers all edges in  except possibly edges . For each gadget  inserted between  we know if both of  then from lemma ~\ref{VCJ} we require five additional vertices to cover .
For covering the edge  in  we need at least one of , so we modify  to include any one of  and four more vertices from  (note that the size of the vertex cover remains unchanged after this operation). After repeating this operation for all matching edges where it is necessary, we have that  forms a vertex cover of size  for .
\qed

\iffalse
\begin{itemize}
 \item  :
Consider a vertex cover  of .
, . So for each  corrosponding to  we need exactly 4 more vertices 
to cover  by lemma ~\ref{VCJ}.
But , so  vertices are sufficient to cover .

\item  
Let  be a , and . Then  covers all edges in  except possibly edges 
For each gadget  inserted between  we know if both of  then from lemma ~\ref{VCJ} we require
5 more vertex to cover .
For covering the edge  in  we need at least one of , so we modify  to include any one of  and 4 more vertices from .
So that  forms a vertex cover for .


\end{itemize}
\fi

\end{proof}


We now turn to the gadgets that add to the degree of every vertex in the graph, turning it into a four-regular graph. For this we need a new gadget, which we refer to as  (indexed by ), as shown in figure ~\ref{tildeJ}. Here irrespective of whether  is 
included or not we require  vertices as  and
 induce complete graphs. Further, we can include  in vertex cover to cover edges incident to vertices in , and we will also cover any of the edges connecting these vertices to the rest of the graph. Now we are ready to describe the actual construction.  




We arbitrarily order the edges in matching, say as follows:
 and

 

We will follow this ordering in every step of reduction wherever required.
Note that all
 vertices of  in  are still degree 3 vertices, where . We insert a copy of gadget  between edges  and  to
increase the degree of the vertices  and . We do this
by adding edges  and .
for , where the index computed modulo . 
We refer to the graph constructed above as . It is easy to see that  thus obtained is a -regular graph.

In lemma~\ref{3to4regular}, we establish the relation between vertex cover of  and vertex cover of .


\begin{lemma}The graph  has a vertex cover of size  if, and only if, has a vertex cover of size , where .
\label{3to4regular} 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

In the forward direction, suppose  has a vertex cover of size .
Since , only extra edges in  are those adjacent to vertices of gadgets  for .
From  if we include vertices , then they will cover all edges that are adjacent to at least one vertex in , for all . This implies that  vertices are sufficient to cover all edges of .

In the reverse direction, let  be a vertex cover of size  for , and let . For each , we need 6 vertices to cover edges adjacent to .  Therefore . It is easy to see that  is a vertex cover for .
\qed
\end{proof}




\iffalse 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 

Since , only extra edges in  are those adjacent to vertices of gadgets  for .
From  if we include vertices , then they will cover all edges that are adjacent to at least one vertex in , for all .
This implies that  vertices are sufficient to cover .

\item 

Let .
For each  we need 6 vertices to cover edges adjacent to .  Therefore 
, otherwise if more vertices are included from  we can transform the vertex cover to contain exactly six vertex from . 
If  is not the vertex cover for  then  s.t. .But 
then , so  does not cover , a contradiction. So,  forms a .
\end{enumerate}
\fi


Again, for ease of describing paths at the end of this discussion, we define 
and  be the two paths that cover all vertices and edges of . Combining the two steps of the reduction above, we have the following.


\begin{corollary}
Let . The graph  admits a vertex cover of size  if, and only if, the graph  has a vertex cover of size . 
\label{WSDNPH}
\end{corollary}

\paragraph{An useful 2-factor decomposition of .}
\label{2-factor} From Corollary 2.1.5(Petersen 1891) in ~\cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0030488}, every -regular graph has a -factor as a subgraph. Here, we give an explicit partition of  into two -factors, namely .  Initially, let  be empty (no vertices). We have fixed a matching
 of  and  of  corresponding to which  was constructed.

Recall that for the construction of , we have deleted the matching edge  and inserted gadget , for  and  and increased the degree of each vertices
 corresponding to matching edges  and 
corresponding to matching edge  by connecting it to gadget  for  (index computed modulo ). 

We now construct two two-factors which will be convenient for us in the next phase of the reduction. These two-factors will be highly structured in the following sense. The first cycle in both two-factors will involve all the vertices of  and , respectively, and some vertices from the gadgets. The rest of the graph now decomposes into a collection of cycles which get distributed in a natural way. we now describe this formally. 

The first cycle  that we include in  contains all vertices of  and ,  that are in ,
similarly the first cycle  we include in  contains all vertices of  and , .

Specifically, the first cycle included in  is .

Similarly, the first cycle  included in  is .


For  to be one of the factors we require cycles in  containing vertices of  present in , so we include the cycles , for  and
refer to these set of cycles as . Since we have already used two degrees of vertices of  we are left with degree two from each vertex which forms disjoint union of cycles, so we let  denote the set of cycles that is left in the graph . Similarly we include in  the cycles , for  and refer to them by 
and include the graph  after deleting already included edge in corresponding cycle and refer to cycles obtained after deletion by .



Let  be set of cycles in  and  respectively.
We will choose  such that ,  and ,
.
We will delete vertices in  and insert some other set of vertices, the aim is to break all cycles at some vertices 
and stitch together the broken cycles in  to form one of the hamiltonin path and similarly form the other hamiltonian path using
the cycles in .

Initially let . Let    and  and . Observe that the cycles in  and  are disjoint among them (no common vertex), so we select one vertex from each cycle  and include it in  and 
.
Note that the vertex selected from cycles in  and  are present in the cycle ,
similarly vertex selected from cycles in  and  are present in the cycle .

\paragraph{From Constructed 4-regular graph with 2-factoring  to a \braid{} graph.} We order the cycles in  and  and call the ordered sequence of cycles as . The first cycle in  is , 
next we arbitrary order the cycles in 
from  and include in ,
and then we arbitrarily order the cycles in  from  and include in .

It is easy to see that once we have fixed the ordering of cycles in  we already have the corresponding ordering of cycles in  which is given by the function  indicating the graph isomorphism 
from  to . Also we order the vertices in  corresponding to the ordering of cycles of . First, we give the gadgets that we will use for breaking cycles that ensures 
the hamiltonian property and relates the vertex cover of  to the vertex cover of new graph constructed.

\paragraph{Gadgets used for reduction} The third gadget  that we use for the reduction is shown in figure~\ref{W}[b] (indexed by ).
It is easy to see that it has exactly 2 paths from  to  [refer figure~\ref{path1}(a),~\ref{path1}(b)], where each path
covers all vertices of  and all the path created by deletion of vertex from one of the cycles. Note other than the edges covered in this two paths we do not have any other edge in .

We create a new graph  as follows. Initially we have .
As  is a 4-regular graph therefore  has four neighbors say  and  and
let  be neighbor of  in cycle 
and  be neighbors of  in cycle .
We delete  from the graph  and insert  and add edges  and . Since in 
if at least one of  is not chosen in vertex cover then we have to include  in the vertex cover. So by  we ensure that if at least one of
 is not chosen in the vertex cover then the size of vertex cover increases exactly by one indicating in vertex cover for  we need to include vertex 
[refer lemma~\ref{W1vc}].




\begin{lemma}
We can cover all edges of  with  s.t.  and  and
if at least one of  is in  then we can cover all edges with a  s.t.
 and this is minimum required.
\label{W1vc}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The vertex sets , , ,  form triangles
and  is an edge, therefore we require minimum of 9 vertices to cover edges of . If we have  then we can cover all edges of  with 9 vertices.


If at least one of  or  is forced due to one of  or  not chosen respectively, say  is forced then apart from the 's present we have an 
edge , so including  we need at least 10 vertices,
similar argument can be given when  is forced (edge  left).
If we have  then we can cover all edges of  with 10 vertices.
\qed

\label{W2}
\end{figure}


In Figure~\ref{W2} we show fourth gadget  used for reduction and in Figure~\ref{W2-PATH} we show that
there are no extra edges other that two paths covering all vertices of  from  and
. The need of this gadget is when we have a cycle in which more than one vertex is deleted,
and we do not have a path for at least one neighbor of deleted vertex to attach to gadget , refer Figure~\ref{W2}[a].

\caption{Edge Set of gadget  is exactly union of two hamiltonian paths. (a),(b) showing two path from  to  covering all edges in .}
\label{W2-PATH}
\end{figure}

In Lemma~\ref{vctildew} we prove the minimum number of vertices required to cover edges of  and in Lemma~\ref{tildwwvc17}
we prove that if at least one neighbor of deleted vertex say  for which  is inserted is not chosen in vertex cover then
we require 10 vertices to cover the edges and if all neighbors are included then we require 9 vertices only.


\begin{lemma}
 To cover edges of gadget , 9 vertices are necessary and sufficient.
 \label{vctildew}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider gadget  [figure~\ref{W2}].
, ,
forms  and     are edges (all vertex disjoint), so we require at least 9 vertices to cover all edges of .
If   then
can cover all edges of  with

\caption{Gadget , double circled vertex forming a minimum vertex cover and empty circle showing outside vertex to which  is connected and dotted lines connection to them}
\label{gadgetW_c}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}
 Consider a vertex  and , .
 Let neighbors of  be . Here  is deleted and  is inserted as shown in figure ~\ref{W2}.
 If at least one of  is not included in vertex cover then minimum number of vertex required
 to cover  
 apart from  is 10.
 \label{tildwwvc17}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We know that ,  form triangles, so we require at least 4 vertices among them.


Suppose  is not chosen in the vertex cover so  is forced, but then we have
  
as vertex disjoint edges left to be covered.
Suppose  is not chosen in the vertex cover so  is forced, but then we have

as vertex disjoint edges left to be covered.
Similarly if  forced due to  not chosen in vertex cover we have edges left as

and for  forced we have

If we have
, then we can cover all edges in  with 10 vertices when at least one of  is not chosen in the vertex cover.
\qed
\end{proof}

\paragraph{The Overall Connection.} The fifth (and final) gadget used is denoted by , and is shown in figure \ref{gadgetW_c}. We use this gadget for connecting broken cycles. It is easy to see that the gadget itself is an union of two hamiltonian paths, and that we need four vertices to cover all the edges. We have fixed the ordering of cycles , and we use this for the overall connection.

For cycle  let the vertex from which the specified path (path hamiltonian with respect to  and inserted gadget to break cycle) starts be  and where it ends be ,
similarly for cycles  let the start vertex be  and end vertex be .
For a cycle  and  we insert the gadget  and add edges ,
for , where  is the number of cycles in . It is easy to see that after making these additions, the graph has edges which is exactly union of two hamiltonian paths. One of the hamiltonian path starting from  and ending at  and second hamiltonian path starting at  and ending at .

Putting together all the constructions described above and using the translations of the vertex cover at every stage, we have the following result. 

\begin{theorem}
The problem of finding a vertex cover of size at most  in a braid graph is \NPC{}.

\section{An Improved Branching Algorithm}

In this section we describe an improved FPT algorithm for the vertex cover problem on graphs with maximum degree at most four. 
The algorithm is essentially a search tree, and the analysis is based on the branch-and-bound technique. We use standard notation with regards to branching vectors as described in~\cite{RN}.The input to the algorithm is denoted by a pair , where  is a graph, and the question is whether  admits a vertex cover of size at most . 

We work with , the size of the vertex cover sought, as the measure --- sometimes referred to as the \emph{budget}. When we say that we \emph{branch on a vertex~}, we mean that we recursively generate two instances, one where  belongs to the vertex cover, the other where  does not belong to the vertex cover. 
This is a standard method of exhaustive branching, where the measure drops, respectively, by one and  in the two branches (since the neighbors of  are forced to be in the vertex cover when  does not belong to the vertex cover).  

\paragraph{Preprocessing.} 

We begin by eliminating simplicial vertices, that is, vertices whose neighborhoods form a clique. If the graph induced by  is a clique, then it is easy to see that there is a minimum vertex cover containing  and not containing  (by a standard shifting argument). We therefore preprocess the graph in such a situation by deleting  and reducing the budget to . 




Our algorithm makes extensive use of the \emph{folding} technique, as described in past work~\cite{CKJ99,CKX06}. This allows us to preprocess vertices of degree two in polynomial time, while also reducing the size of the vertex cover sought by one. We briefly describe how we might handle degree-2 vertices in polynomial time.
Suppose  is a degree- vertex in the graph  with two neighbors  and  such that  and  are not adjacent to each other. We construct a new graph  as follows: 
remove the vertices , , and  and introduce a new 
vertex  that is adjacent to all neighbors of the vertices  and  in  (other than ). We say that the graph  is obtained from the graph  by ``folding'' the vertex , and we say 
that  is the vertex generated by folding , or simply that  is the \emph{folded vertex} (when the context is clear). It turns out that the folding operation preserves equivalence, as shown below. 

\begin{proposition}\cite[Lemma 2.3]{CKJ99}
Let  be a graph obtained by folding a degree- vertex  in a graph , where the two neighbors of  are not adjacent to each other. Then the graph  has a vertex cover of size bounded by  if and only if the graph  has a vertex cover of size bounded by .
\end{proposition}

Note that the new vertex generated by the folding operation can have more than four neighbors, especially if the vertices adjacent to 
the degree two vertex have, for example, degree four to begin with. The branching algorithm that we will propose assumes that we will always find a 
vertex whose degree is bounded by  to branch on, therefore it is important to avoid the situation where the graph obtained after folding all available degree two vertices is completely devoid of vertices of degree bounded by three 
(which is conceivable if all degree three vertices are adjacent to degree two vertices that in turn get affected by the folding operation). 
Therefore, we apply the folding operation somewhat tactfully we apply it only when we are sure that the folded vertex has degree at most four. We call such a vertex a \emph{foldable} vertex.
Further, a vertex is said to be \emph{easily foldable} if, after folding, it has degree at most .
We avert the danger of leading ourselves to a four-regular graph recursively by explicitly ensuring that vertices of degree at most three are created whenever a folded vertex has degree four.
Note that in the preprocessing step we will be folding only easily foldable vertices.



Typically, we ensure a reasonable drop on all branches by creating the following win-win situation: if a vertex is foldable, then we fold it, if it is not, 
then this is the case since there are sufficiently many neighbors in the second neighborhood of the vertex, and in many situations, this would lead to a good branching vector. Also, during the course of the branching, we appeal to a couple of simple facts about the structure of a vertex cover, which we state below.




\begin{lemma}\cite[First part of Lemma 3.2]{CKJ99}
\label{lem:deg3neighborhood}
Let  be a vertex of degree  in a graph . Then there is a minimum vertex cover
of  that contains either all three neighbors of  or at most one neighbor of .
\end{lemma}



This follows from the fact that a vertex cover that contains  (where ) and two of its neighbors can be easily transformed into one, of the same size, that omits  and contains all of its neighbors. 

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:c4}
If  form a cycle of length four in  (in that order), and the degree of  and  in  is two, then there exists an optimal vertex cover that does not pick  or  and contains both  and .
\end{proposition}

\longversion{
\begin{proof}
Let  be an optimal vertex cover. Any vertex cover must pick at least two vertices among . If  and  belong to , 
then clearly  does not contain  and  (otherwise  would continue to be a vertex cover, contradicting optimality). 
If  does not contain  (or , or both), then  must contain both  and . Note that  is a vertex cover 
whose size is at most , and is a vertex cover of the desired size. 
\qed
\end{proof}
}

\paragraph{Overall Algorithm.} To begin with, the branching algorithm tries to branch mainly on a vertex of degree three or two. If the input graph is four-regular, 
then we simply branch on an arbitrary vertex to create two instances both of which have at least one vertex of degree at most three. We note that this is 
an off-branching step, in the future, the algorithm maintains the invariant that at each step, the smaller graph produced has at least one vertex whose degree is at most three. 





\longversion{



}


After this, we remove all the simplicial vertices and then fold all easily-foldable vertices. If a degree two vertex  with neighbors  and  is not easily-foldable,
then note that there exists an optimal vertex cover that either contains  or does not contain  and includes both its neighbors. 
Indeed, if an optimal vertex cover  contains, say  and , then note that  is a vertex cover of the same size. So we branch on the vertex :

\begin{itemize}
\item when  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick  in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of two in the measure,
\item when  does belong to the vertex cover, we have that  must belong to the vertex cover,
and we know that  (otherwise,  would be easily-foldable), and this leads to a drop of five in the measure. 
\end{itemize}

So we either preprocess degree two vertices in polynomial time, or branch on them with a branching vector of \branchvector{2,5}. At the leaves of this branching tree, if we have a sub-cubic graph,
then we employ the algorithm of~\cite{X10}. Otherwise, we have at least one degree three vertex which is adjacent to at least one degree four vertex. 
We branch on these vertices next. The case analysis is based on the neighborhood of the vertex --- broadly, we distinguish between when the neighborhood  
has at least one edge, and when it has no edges. The latter case is the most demanding in terms of a case analysis. For the rest of this section, we describe all the scenarios that arise in this context.






\paragraph{Degree three vertices with edges in their neighborhood.}

For this part of the algorithm, we can always assume that we are given a degree three vertex with a degree four neighbor. 
Let  be a degree three vertex, and let~, where we let  denote a degree four vertex.
Note that  does not form a triangle, otherwise  would be a simplicial vertex and we would have handled it earlier.
So, we deal with the case when  is not a triangle, but has at least one edge. If  is an edge, then we branch on :

\begin{itemize}
\item when  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick four of its neighbors in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of four in the measure,
\item when  does belong to the vertex cover, we delete  from the graph, and we are left with  being a triangle where  is a degree two vertex, and 
therefore we may pick  in the vertex cover --- together, this leads to a drop of three in the measure. 
\end{itemize}



On the other hand, if  is not an edge, then there is an edge incident to . Suppose the edge is  (the case when the edge is  is symmetric). In this case, we branch on  
exactly as above. The measure may drop by three when  does not belong to the vertex cover, if  happens to be a degree three vertex. Therefore, our worst-case 
branching vector in the situation when  is not a triangle, but has at least one edge is \branchvector{3,3}.

\paragraph{Degree three vertices whose neighborhoods are independent.} 

Here we consider several cases. Broadly, we have two situations based on whether  have any common neighbors or not.

First, suppose there exists a vertex  that is adjacent to at least two vertices in . Here, let us begin by considering the situation when  is adjacent to  and one other vertex. We will call this {\bf Scenario A}.

In this scenario, we distinguish two cases based on the degree of , and whether  is adjacent to a degree four vertex or not.
Here after for ease in specification we will refer to a degree  vertex also as a foldable vertex. 

\begin{enumerate}[series=main,label=\bfseries Case~\arabic*:] \item {\bf The vertex  has degree four.} Here, we branch on  as follows. We let  to be an edge in the graph.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If  belongs to the vertex cover, then we delete  from . Then, if  is foldable in the resulting graph, then we fold . Otherwise, we branch further on :
\begin{enumerate}
\item when  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick  in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of two in the measure. Here, we delete  and , after which  becomes a degree two vertex. Let  denote the two neighbors of . Then, if  is foldable in the resulting graph, then we fold . Otherwise, we branch on :
\begin{enumerate}
\item when  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick  in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of two in the measure.
\item when  does belong to the vertex cover, we have that  must belong to the vertex cover, and this leads to a drop of six in the measure.
\end{enumerate}
\item when  does belong to the vertex cover, we have that  must belong to the vertex cover, and we know that  (otherwise,  would be foldable), and this leads to a drop of six in the measure.
\end{enumerate}
\item If  does not belong to the vertex cover, then we pick all of its neighbors in the vertex cover. Since the degree of  is four, this leads the measure to drop by four. 
Also, after removing  from , the vertex  lose two neighbors (namely  and ). If it is foldable, then we proceed by folding the said vertex. 
Otherwise, we branch further on , letting  denote the neighbors of .
\begin{enumerate}  
\item when  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick  in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of two in the measure,
\item when  does belong to the vertex cover, we have that  and this leads to a drop of six in the measure. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


Depending on the situations that arise, the branching vectors can be one of the following (we use  to denote the vertex cover that will be output by the algorithm):

\begin{itemize}
\item  is foldable in , and  is foldable in . \branchvector{2,5}
\item  is foldable in ,  is not foldable in , and  is foldable in . \branchvector{7,4,5}
\item  is foldable in ,  is not foldable in , and  not foldable in . \branchvector{7,9,5,5}
\item  is not foldable in , and  is foldable in . \branchvector{2,10,6}
\item  is not foldable in ,  is not foldable in , and  is foldable in . \branchvector{7,4,10,6}
\item  is not foldable in ,  is not foldable in , and  is not foldable in . \branchvector{7,9,5,10,6}
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

The reason we needed to have  in the case above was to ensure that we have a vertex that we can either fold or branch on in the graph , which is the situation that arises
when  is not foldable, and  is included in the vertex cover. If  and  both have degree three, then  is indeed foldable and the branching above gives the desired guarantee. 
Otherwise, if  has degree three and in particular  is an edge, then  becomes isolated in this situation, and we have no clear way of further progress. 
}

Before embarking on the case analysis, we describe a branching strategy for some specific situations --- these mostly involve two non-adjacent vertices that
have more than two neighbhors in common, with at least one of them of degree . This will be useful in scenarios that arise later.

We consider the case when a degree four vertex  non-adjacent to a vertex  has at least three neighbhors in commmon, say  and let  be the other neighbhor of  that may or may not be adjacent to . 
Notice that there always exists an optimal vertex cover that either contains both  and  or omits both  and . To see this, consider an optimal vertex cover  that contains 
 and omits . Then,  clearly contains . Notice now that  is also a vertex cover, and
 contains neither  or , and has the same size as . This suggests the following branching strategy:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If  and  both belong to the vertex cover, then the measure clearly drops by two. We proceed by deleting  and  from . Now note that the degree of the vertices  reduces by two, 
and they become vertices of degree one or two (note that they cannot be isolated because we always begin by eliminating vertices of degree two by preprocessing or branching). If any one of these vertices is simplicial or
foldable then we process it or fold it respectively. Otherwise, we branch on :
\begin{enumerate}
\item when  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick its neighbhors in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of two in the measure.
\item when  does belong to the vertex cover, we have that its second neighborhood must belong to the vertex cover, and this leads to a drop of six in the measure.
\end{enumerate}
\item If  and  are both omitted from the vertex cover, then we pick  in the vertex cover and the measure drops by four.


\end{enumerate}

Note that if  is foldable in , then we have the branch vector \branchvector{3,4}, otherwise, we have the branch vector \branchvector{4,8,4}.
We refer to the branching strategies outlined above as the {\bf CommonNeighborBranch} strategy.



\longversion{

We now continue our case analysis. Recall that we would like to address the situation that  is degree three and all of its neighbors are common with , and further that at least one of  or  have degree four. Let us say, without loss of generality, that  has degree four.

 
\begin{enumerate}[resume=main,label=\bfseries Case~\arabic*:]
\item {\bf The vertex  has degree three, the vertices  have degree four, and .}

Here, we let  and  denote the neighbors of . Our case analysis is now based on the degrees of these vertices.



\begin{enumdescript}
\item[At least one of  or  has degree three.]

Suppose, without loss of generality, that  has degree three. Note that  and  are two non-adjacent degree four vertices. The vertices  and  are already in their 
common neighborhood. If they have more common neighbors, then we branch according to the {\bf CommonNeighborBranch} strategy. Otherwise, we branch on the vertex  as follows. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item If  belongs to the vertex cover, then we delete  from . Here, the measure drops by one. In the remaining graph, branch on :
\begin{enumerate}
\item When  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick the neighbors of  in the vertex cover. Since  is not in the vertex cover, and  is in the vertex cover, we know by 
Lemma~\ref{lem:deg3neighborhood} that the neighbors of  and  must be in the vertex cover. Note that  and  have no common neighbhors other than  and , otherwise the {\bf CommonNeighborBranch} strategy
would apply. Therefore, we have that the measure drops by at least six more (the vertex  has at least four neighbors and  has at least two private neighbors). 
\item When  does belong to the vertex cover, then we also pick  in the vertex cover (note that to cover the edge , we may pick  without loss of generality if both  and  are in
the vertex cover). Further, we fold  if it is foldable, otherwise we branch on :
\begin{enumerate}
\item When  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick its neighbhors in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of two in the measure.
\item When  does belong to the vertex cover, we have that its second neighborhood must belong to the vertex cover, and this leads to a drop of six in the measure.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate}    
\item If  does not belong to the vertex cover, then we pick all of its neighbors in the vertex cover. This immediately leads the measure to drop by four. Also, after removing  from , the vertex  loses
two neighbors (namely  and ). If  is foldable we fold , otherwise we branch on :
\begin{enumerate}  
\item When  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick  in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of two in the measure,
\item When  does belong to the vertex cover, we have that  and this leads to a drop of six in the measure. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


Depending on the situations that arise, the branching vectors can be one of the following (we use  to denote the vertex cover that will be output by the algorithm):

\begin{itemize}
\item  is foldable in , and  is foldable in . \branchvector{4,7,5}
\item  is foldable in , and  is not foldable in . \branchvector{9,5,7,5}
\item  is not foldable in , and  is foldable in . \branchvector{4,7,10,6}
\item  is not foldable in , and  is not foldable in . \branchvector{9,5,7,10,6}

This completes the description of {\bf Scenario A}, where we assumed that  was adjacent to . Now, let us turn to the situation when   is not adjacent to . Since we are in the setting where  is adjacent to two neighbors of , this implies that  and  are both neighbors of . In fact, we can even assume that both  and  are vertices of degree three, otherwise we would be in {\bf Scenario A} by a simple renaming of vertices. We call this setup {\bf Scenario B}.

Here, we simply branch on the vertex , as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If  belongs to the vertex cover, then we delete  from . In the resulting graph,  is evidently a foldable degree two vertex, so we fold . Notice that the measure altogether drops by two in this branch.
\item If  does not belong to the vertex cover, then we pick all its neighbors in the vertex cover. After removing , note that  and  have degree two. If either of them are foldable, then we proceed by folding. Otherwise, we branch on :
\begin{enumerate}
\item When  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick its neighbhors in the vertex cover, leading to a drop of two in the measure.
\item When  does belong to the vertex cover, we have that its second neighborhood must belong to the vertex cover, and this leads to a drop of six in the measure.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Note that if  is foldable in , then we have a branch vector of \branchvector{2,5}, otherwise, we have a branch vector of \branchvector{2,6,10}. Now we have covered all the cases that arise when the neighbors of  have a shared neighbor other than , which we called .

The remaining case is when the vertices  have no common neighbors other than . We call this {\bf Scenario C} .
Here, we have cases depending on the degree of  and  --- the first setting is when both  are vertex of degree three. Second when both have degree four and third when one has degree three and other has degree four. 






\begin{enumerate}[series=scenarioC,label=\bfseries Case~\arabic*:]
\item {\bf When the degree of both  and  is three.}
This branching is identical to the branching for {\bf Sceneario B}. Note that the important aspect there was the fact that  is foldable 
in , which continues to be the case here. It is easy to check that all other elements are identical. 

\item {\bf When the degree of both  and  is four.}
In this case, we branch on . 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If  belongs to the vertex cover, then we delete  from . Here, the measure drops by one. In the remaining graph, branch on :
\begin{enumerate}
\item When  does not belong to the vertex cover, we pick the neighbors of  in the vertex cover and the measure drops by three. 
\item When  does belong to the vertex cover and we are in case when  is in vertex cover, we know by Lemma~\ref{lem:deg3neighborhood} that the neighbors of  and  must be in the vertex cover. 
 Note that  and  have no common neighbors other than  (or we would be in {\bf Scenario A} or {\bf Scenario B}). 
But, both  and  are degree four vertex with no vertex common in their neighborhood other than , so we include in vertex cover neighbhors of  and  and delete from graph ,
with a total drop in the measure by 8.
\end{enumerate}    
\item If  does not belong to the vertex cover, then we pick all of its neighbors in the vertex cover and we branch on .
\begin{enumerate}
 \item When  does not belong to the vertex cover, we include all neighbhors of  in the vertex cover to get a total drop of .
 \item When  does belong to the vertex cover, and we have that  is not in the vertex cover, we know by Lemma~\ref{lem:deg3neighborhood} that neighbors of  and  must be in vertex cover. So we include
 neighbors of  and  in the vertex cover, to get a total drop of .
\end{enumerate}

Here we have the branch vector as .
\end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}[resume=scenarioC,label=\bfseries Case~\arabic*:]
\item {\bf When the degree of  is four and  is three.}
We let the two other neighbors of  to be . If  is a degree  vertex and  is a degree  vertex (or vice-versa) then we have a degree  vertex  adjacent 
to two degree  vertex  and a degree  vertex
 and we can apply the rules in {\bf Scenario : case }. So we are left with two cases one when both  are degree  vertex and second when both  are degree  vertex.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Both  are degree three vertex. In this case we branch on .
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item When  does belong to the vertex cover then we branch on .
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item When  does not belong to the vertex cover then we include neighbhors of  in the vertex cover, to get a drop in the measure by .
   \item When  does belong to the vertex cover and we know  is in vertex cover, we know by Lemma~\ref{lem:deg3neighborhood} that neighbors of  are in vertex cover. So we include neighbors of  in vertex cover and get
   a drop in measure by .
  \end{enumerate}
  \item When  does not belong to the vertex cover. Then we include neighbors of  in the vertex cover and delete  from the graph. Now  is a degree  vertex and ,
  so we fold  to get a drop of one more in the measure.
  

  Here we have the branch vector as .
 \end{enumerate}
\item Both  are degree four vertex. We branch on .

\begin{enumerate}
 \item When  does not belong to the vertex cover, we get an immediate drop of four in the measure. We delete  from the graph, after deletion  is a degree  vertex. If  is foldable we fold  and get a drop of ,
 otherwise we branch on .
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item When  does belong to the vertex cover then we include neighborhood of  and  in the vertex cover and get a total drop in the measure of atleast .
  \item When  does not belong in the vertex cover then we include neighbhors of  in the vertex cover and get a total drop of .
 \end{enumerate}
\item When  does belong to the vertex cover, we branch on .
\begin{enumerate}
 \item When  does belong to the vertex cover, we know by Lemma~\ref{lem:deg3neighborhood} that neighbhors of  and  are in vertex cover. So we inlcude neighbhors of  and  in the vertex cover and get 
 a total drop of  in the measure.
 \item When  does not belong to the vertex cover, we get an immediate drop in measure by , now we branch on .
 \begin{itemize}
  \item When  does belong to the vertex cover and we are in the case when  not belong to the vertex cover, we know by Lemma~\ref{lem:deg3neighborhood} that neighbhors of  must be in vertex cover.
  So we include neighbors of  in the vertex cover and get a total drop in the measure by 
  \item When  does not belong to the vertex cover then we include neighbhors of  in the vertex cover and get a total drop of  in the measure.
 \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

If  is foldable in  we have the branch vector , otherwise the branch vector is .
 \end{enumerate}










\end{enumerate}




Note that the correctness of the algorithm is implicit in the description, and follows from the fact that the cases are exhaustive and so is the branching. The branch vectors are summarized in Figure~\ref{tab:runningtime}. We have, consequently, the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
The \name{Vertex Cover} problem on graphs that have maximum degree at most four can be solved in  worst-case running time.

\section{Conclusions}

In this work we showed that the problem of hitting all axis-parallel slabs induced by a point set  is equivalent to the problem of finding a vertex cover on a graph whose edge set is the union of two Hamiltonian Paths. We established that this problem is \NPC{}. Finally, we also gave an algorithm for Vertex Cover on graphs of maximum degree four whose running time is .  It would be interesting to know if there are better algorithms for braid graphs in particular.
