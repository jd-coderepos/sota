\begin{abstract}
Compressed sensing (CS) is a challenging problem in image processing due to reconstructing an almost complete image from a limited measurement. To achieve fast and accurate CS reconstruction, we synthesize the advantages of two well-known methods (neural network and optimization algorithm) to propose a novel optimization inspired neural network which dubbed AMP-Net. AMP-Net realizes the fusion of the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm and neural network. All of its parameters are learned automatically. Furthermore, we propose an AMPA-Net which uses three attention networks to improve the representation ability of AMP-Net. Finally, We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMP-Net and AMPA-Net on four standard CS reconstruction benchmark data sets. Our code is available on https://github.com/puallee/AMPA-Net.

\section{Introduction}
Compressed sensing (CS) [1-2] theory demonstrates that we can recover a signal from a limited measurement with a high probability if it is sparse in some optimal transform. This new technology is hardware-friendly and widely used in many fields, such as fast magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [3], fast and low-dose X-ray imaging [4], radio astronomy imaging [5], single-pixel camera [6] and 3D-video [7]. In this paper, we focus on the CS of natural images, however, our framework can be generalized to other types of data as well.
We show examples of CS in Fig.1. We define that the size of image signal  is , sensing matrix is , the size of measurement  is , the degree of under-sampling as CS ratios is /, and it also means sampling cost. We reconstruct an almost clear image from the measurement . CS can be written as an optimization for  norm problem which is presented in Eq. (1):
 
  is a regularization parameter for sparsity, and D is the optimal transform. 
\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:CS} \end{figure}
\\Optimization algorithms, neural networks, and optimization-inspired neural networks are mainly used in CS reconstruction. Optimization algorithms: Eq.(1) can be solved by optimization algorithms, such as alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [9], iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA)[10], and approximate message passing (AMP) [11]. However, these methods are slow to converge. Because natural images are typically non-stationary, it is heavily laboring and time-consuming to design sensing matrix   and optimal transform D. Neural network: a fast implicit model for CS Reconstruction, such as DR2-Net [12], Recon-Net [13], Adaptive-Recon-Net [14]. These methods lack accuracy because they do not use prior knowledge of Eq.(1). Optimization-inspired neural network: it achieves the fusion of neural network and optimization algorithm to maintain accuracy and fast speed, such as ADMM-Net [3] fusing ADMM and circular convolution, ISTA-Net [15] fusing ISTA and convolution neural network. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-inspired neural network which fuses AMP and neural network, dubbed as AMP-Net, including full connection layer for adaptive sensing, AMP algorithm  and balanced CNN for CS reconstruction. The whole network is trained end to end through Charbonnier loss function. Furthermore, we introduce three attention networks to further improve the performance of CS. 
\\In this paper, Our contributions are four-fold: 
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose an AMP-Net to synthesize the advantages of approximate messaging passing and neural networks. Our method deal with the problem of fast and accurate CS reconstruction.
\item Its enhanced version AMPA-Net use three attention networks to improve CS reconstruction performance.
\item To best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose AMP-Net based on the optimization-inspired neural network and our AMPA-Net is the first to incorporate feature attention for deep compressed sensing.
\item Extensive experiments on four standard benchmark data sets (\textit{i.e.}, Set11, BSD68, BSDS100, and Urban100) show that our methods can reach state-of-the-art performance in CS reconstruction.
\end{itemize}
\section{Related Work}
In this section, we give a brief review of the optimization-inspired neural network, AMP algorithm, and attention mechanism which are most relevant to our method.
\subsection{Optimization-inspired neural network}
The existing optimization-inspired neural networks, including ADMM-Net, ISTA-Net, and ISTA-Net, usually achieve the fusion of an optimization algorithm and a neural network to synthesize the advantages of both of them. This fusion depends on the similarity between the optimization algorithm and the neural network: (1) the calculation of optimization algorithms are usually differentiable, we can use propagated backward [16] to learn their parameters. (2) Iteration of the optimization algorithm is similar to the deep stacking of neural networks [3]. The optimization can unroll into depth structure.
Through fusion, the structure of these networks has some well-defined explanatory. What's more, they can combine the advantages of optimization algorithm and neural network to achieve fast and accurate CS reconstruction.
\subsection{AMP algorithm}
The AMP algorithm is inspired by the message passing in graph theory [11]. Considering some existing errors of CS reconstruction in each iteration in ISTA, AMP adds an Onsager reaction term, which improves the phase transition [17] to get an accurate solution. Furthermore, the AMP algorithm has a strong expansibility. First, AMP combine with a well-defined denoising filter, such as: NLM-AMP [18], BM3D-prgamp [19]. Second, AMP combine with trained denoising filer, such as: LD-AMP [20]. However, there is no real fusion through end to end learning in the above methods.
\subsection{Attention mechanism}
The attention mechanism is an effective method in deep learning, such as SE-Net[22] in image classification, RCAN [23]  in image super-resolution. In CS, we introduce three attention networks to redistribute spatial and channel information of our AMP-Net.
\section{AMP-Net}
The overview structure of AMP-Net is illustrated in Fig.2. Its structure can be corresponding to Algorithm.2.  We will describe our approach in detail from three aspects: Algorithm, Framework, and  Loss function.
\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{AMPNet.jpg} \caption{The diagram of proposed AMP-Net,parts of the formulas is amp algorithm, the others are neural network}
\label{fig:AMPNet} \end{figure*}
\subsection{Algorithm}
David[11] proposed an AMP algorithm to solve Eq.(1), AMP algorithm is presented in Algorithm.1.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Approximate Message Passing}
\label{alg:Approximate Message Passing}
\begin{algorithmic}
\REQUIRE 
\ENSURE 
\\ 
\\Initialization
\STATE {} 
\\While not converge,do:
       \STATE 
       \STATE 
        \STATE 
        \\

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
In Algorithm.1, the input is measurement  and handcrafted sensing matrix . The output is reconstructed image .
AMP includes initialization and iteration. In initialization,  is handcrafted optimal transform,  is reconstructed sparse representation[21].  is a pseudo-inverse operation. 
In iteration,  is an iteration index, is current residual.  is threshold function for    regulation, and  is its derivative of function input.  and   are scale factors.  is the Onsager reaction item to improve phase transition. In their experiments, AMP needs almost one hundred of iteration to converge for neural images. 

\subsection{Framework}
In this part, we expand the traditional AMP to achieve fusion of AMP and neural network. For AMP, when  exists orthogonality [25] (), AMP can be transformed into Eq.(2):
 
In Eq.(2),  means that D can be different in each iteration. Furthermore, we design a balanced CNN to represent , and this balanced CNN is guided by the AMP algorithm to select the optimal solution , which is presented in Eq.(3):

 is a balanced CNN, it’s parameters is . After that, We also use full-connection layer network for adaptive sensing[14] and initialization to replace handcrafted metric  and  calculation.

\begin{algorithm}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
In Fig.2, arrows direct the flow of AMP-Net.  is learning sense matrix, and   is learning initialization.
we define K iteration as K stacking: (we use K = 9, the traditional AMP usually requires K100), each stacking include AMP calculation and balanced CNN. Inspired by[15], Our balanced CNN contains 5 blocks. Intermediate reconstruction  is input, optimal reconstruction  is output. The 1-st block which is composed of a convolution with  filters. The 2-nd block as  which is composed of a convolution with  filters, batch normalization (BN), Rectified linear unit (ReLU), a convolution with filters. The 3-rd block which is composed of batch normalization (BN) and Rectified linear unit (ReLU), which corresponds to the threshold function  of AMP because of its non-negativity. The 4-th block as   which is composed of a convolution with  filters, batch normalization (BN), Rectified linear unit (ReLU), a convolution with  filters. The 5-th block which is composed of a convolution with  filters. The skip connections (red line) can facilitate training. 

\subsection{Loss function}
Following [13], we use image block as network input to maintain speed and stability, such as in Fig.2, the dimension of blocks is . Given the training data  of each batch size, B is the number of total image block  . To learn the network parameters  in the Algorithm.2, we should not only minimize the CS reconstruction error (), but also consider the orthogonality (, as shown in Eq.(4).

The loss function includes orthogonal constraints , and reconstruction errors ,  is the regularization parameter, we empirically set   to 0.01.


As shown in Eqs.(5-6), Charbonnier penalty function is adopted for  and  with empirically set  to 1e-3.
\section{AMPA-Net}
In this section, the overview structure of AMPA-Net is illustrated in Fig.3, and its structure can be corresponding to Algorithm.3. We will describe our approach in detail from two aspects: Framework and  Attention.
\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{AMPANet.jpg} \caption{The diagram of proposed AMPA-Net,}

\STATE ,
\\For k=1to N:
       \STATE 
       \STATE 
        \STATE 
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Framework}
In Fig.3, the arrow indicates the flow direction of AMPA-Net. We add three more attention networks for AMP-Net: initialization attention network, spatial attention network, and channel attention network. The loss function of AMPA-Net is the same as AMP-Net, as shown in Eq.(4). Comparing with AMP-Net, the learning parameters of network  are added, and others are the same. 
\subsection{Attention}
As mentioned above, we introduce three attention networks for CS reconstruction. These networks are as shown in Fig.4.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{3attention.jpg} \caption{ The diagram of attention networks in AMPA-Net}
\label{fig:3attention} \end{figure}

For the initialization attention network, we use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)  to obtain the attention weight . The MLP is composed of a fully connected layer, Rectified linear unit (ReLU), fully connected layer, and softmax function (Softmax). 

For spatial attention networks,enlightened by CBAM [26], we use both global max-pooling and global average-pooling to aggregate global information. First, global information is aggregated through average-pooling and max-pooling respectively and concatenated. Second, a convolution layer is used to get the spatial attention weight   which is composed of convolution with  filters (Conv) and sigmoid activation function (Sigmoid). Finally, the more informative representation is obtained by element-wise multiplication. 

For channel attention network, enlightened by CBAM [26]: First, global information is aggregated by average-pooling and max-pooling respectively. Second, both of them are forwarded to the same Full Convolution Network, which is composed of convolution with  filters (Conv)(with Zero padding), BN (batch normalization), Rectified linear unit (ReLU), convolution with  filters(Conv)(with Zero padding), and we add two outputs and  get the channel attention weight  through sigmoid function (Sigmoid). Finally, the more informative representation is obtained by element-wise multiplication.

\section{ EXPERIMENT}
In this section, we are divided into four parts: experimental setting, hyperparameters, ablation study, experiments in natural image.
\subsection{ Experiment setting}
\begin{bfseries} 
Network setting:
\end{bfseries}
 We use TensorFlow to implement our methods. In detailed, we use Adam optimization with a learning rate 0.0001, batch size of 64, the model's stacking number of 9, and the regularization parameter  of 0.01. Empirically, we use Xavier initialization for balanced CNN  , Gaussian initialization for for   and the 0.1 initialization for . All models are trained and tested on Linux with GTX 1080ti GPUs.
 
\begin{bfseries} 
Training setting:
\end{bfseries} 
 For the fair comparison, we use the same 91 images as the training set which has been used in previous CS works [12-15]:  random extract luminance component of 8912 randomly cropped image block (each of size ) of the image set. According to different CS ratios: , we train separately AMP-Net and AMP-Net.

\begin{bfseries} 
Testing setting:
\end{bfseries} 
Following [12-15], we use two standard benchmark datasets for testing in CS: Set 11[12], BSD68[32], which have 11 and 68 gray images respectively. To test the generalization ability of our methods in a larger dataset or multichannel dataset, we test RGB image datasets (using the same network to recover the individual channels): Urban100 [28], BSDS100 [29], which have 100 and 100 RGB images.

\subsection{Hyperparameters}

We study the impact of varying hyperparameters (epoch, stacking, batch-size, active function, the regularization parameter , loss function) of AMP-Net and AMPA-Net,  and CS ratio is {25\%}, the test set is Set11 because they are often used [15]. 
First, we study the impact of epoch and stacking numbers of our methods, other hyperparameters follow the previous network setting. Fig.5.(a) shows the average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) curves for Set11 of different numbers of the epoch, Fig.5.(b) shows the average PSNR curves for Set11 of different numbers of stacking. Because of the trade-off between complexity and performance, it can be seen from Fig.5 that epoch 200 and stacking 9 are the most appropriate parameters of our networks.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{T6.png} \caption{The average PSNR curves for with respect to different numbers of stacking and epoch}
\label{T6} \end{figure}

Second, we also study the impact of batch-size and active function of AMP-Net and AMPA-Net, other hyperparameters also follow the previous network setting. Fig.6.(a) shows the average PSNR curves for Set11 of different numbers of batch-size, Fig.6.(b) shows the average PSNR curves for Set11 of different types of activation functions. They show that batch-size 64 and active function ReLU are more suitable for our networks.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{T7.png} \caption{The average PSNR curves for with respect to different batch-size and active function}
\label{T7} \end{figure}
Finally, we also study the impact of the regularization parameter  and loss function and emphasize that other hyperparameters also follow the previous network setting. Fig.7.(a) shows the average PSNR curves for Set11 of different numbers of  , Fig.7.(b) shows the average PSNR curves for Set11 of different types of loss functions.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{loss.png} \caption{The average PSNR curves for with respect to different the regularization parameter  and loss function}
\label{F3} \end{figure}
\subsection{Ablation studies}
In this sub-section, we study the contribution of AMP, balanced CNN ,the sensing network  in AMP-Net,initialization attention, spatial attention  and channel attention  in AMPA-Net, to analyze the effectiveness of each component in our method.
For testing, benchmark data is Set11[13], CS ratios are . The results are shown in Tab.1. 
In Tab.1, compared with single balanced CNN,  single AMP is more important on the accuracy of CS reconstruction.
Compared with the random Gaussian matrix,   can extract more effective information to assist CS reconstruction[30]. The effect of attention mechanism on AMP-Net is more obvious when the CS rate is higher.
\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{Contribution of attention and their combinations in Set11}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{T1.png}
\label{tab:T1}
\end{table}
\subsection{Experiments in natural image}
We compared our proposed AMP-Net, AMPA-Net with the state-of-the-art image CS methods including optimization methods: BM3D-AMP [19], LD-AMP [20]; neural networks: DR2-Net[12], Adaptive-Recon-Net (Ad-Recon-Net)[14], FCMN[32], Full-Conv[33]; optimization-inspired neural networks: ISTA-Net, ISTA-Net[15].  CS ratios are , and the sensing matrix is random Gaussian under-sampling.

\label{tab:T5}
\end{figure}
Tab.2 shows the results of all methods on Set11, including reconstruction accuracy and average time of reconstructing per-image. We observed that ISTA-Net, and ISTA-Net benefited from the optimization-inspired design, achieving high accuracy across all defined CS ratios, as well as maintaining fast speed. The optimization algorithms achieve high accuracy at high CS ratios but maintain low speed, especially LD-AMP. Neural network algorithms achieve well accuracy at low CS ratios as well as maintaining high speed, especially Adaptive Recon-Net. However, our proposed AMP-Net and AMPA-Net almost outperform all the existing methods across all defined CS ratios and also maintain fast speed. Validating the generalizability of our proposed network on larger datasets (BSD68, BSDS100, and Urban100). In Tab.3-5, we compared our models with the state-of-the-art methods: LD-AMP, Ad-Recon-Net, ISTA-Net, and ISTA-Net, and our models still surpasses other methods under all defined CS ratios.
\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, our method have made three highlights: (1) We propose an AMP-Net which achieve the fusion of AMP algorithm and balanced CNN to address the problem of fast and accurate CS reconstruction. (2) We propose the AMPA-Net which uses three attention networks to improve our AMP-Net. (3) Extensive experiments on four CS reconstruction benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of our AMP-Net and AMPA-Net, including the convergence, speed, accuracy of the models, and the contributions of neural network, optimization algorithm, attention module. Since our AMP-Net and AMPA-Net are quite efficient, one direction of interest for our future work is expanding them to deal with other optimization problems and perform a more theoretical analysis of them.
