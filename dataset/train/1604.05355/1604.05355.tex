Talal: I think the paper should be titled: "Experiences deploying extreme edge services as an alternative to core based services". 

S1: Introduction

I agree with Varun below. The pitch is going to be like this. Rural environments are harsh for a variety of reasons, reasons are already listed in intro. Makes providing conventional services hard. We need to go into more detail with respect to how services are being deployed. 
We need to end intro with our various components that help us build edge based services. These components are going to be Backhaul, whitespaces, power and then the services itself is built on top of these. The naming addressing stuff going out. This is going to go in the VC-ISP pitch for GAIA. 


S2: Related Works
Related works is mostly written. We can just bring it up and then see what are the references that are missing. 

S3: Design
Design of various things discussed in intro. 
Architecture, backhaul, whitespaces and power. 

S4: primitives and services

explanation as to why edge services are key to functioning successfully in these regions; various components that are requiered to provides these services
a. seperation of applications into local and cloud components with synchronization primitives between the two
b. CAP specification i.e the battle between C,A,P as and when needed
c. how this seperation+specification makes sense, explicitly in this kind of harsh environment; in this absence of any infrastructural support

S5: Implementation

S6: Evaluation and Discussion
