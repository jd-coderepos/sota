\begin{abstract}
Existing approaches to explaining deep learning models in NLP usually suffer from two major drawbacks:
(1) the main model and the explaining model are decoupled: 
an additional probing or surrogate model is used to  interpret an existing model, and  thus 
existing explaining tools
 are not self-explainable; (2) the probing model is only able to explain a model's predictions by operating on 
 low-level features  
by computing  saliency scores for individual words 
but  are clumsy  at  high-level text units such as phrases, sentences, or paragraphs. 


To deal with these two issues, in this paper, we propose a 
simple yet general and effective 
self-explaining framework  for deep learning models in NLP. 
The key point of the proposed framework is to put an additional layer, as is called by the {\it interpretation layer},  on top of any existing NLP model.  
This layer aggregates the information for each text span, which is then associated with a specific weight, and their weighted combination is fed to the softmax function for the final prediction. 

The proposed model comes with the following merits: 
(1) span weights make the model  self-explainable and do not require an additional probing model for interpretation; 
(2) the proposed model
 is general and can be adapted to any existing deep learning structures in NLP; 
(3) the weight associated with each text span 
 provides direct importance 
  scores for higher-level text units such as phrases and sentences.
We for the first time show that interpretability does not come at the cost of performance: 
a neural model of self-explaining features obtains better performances than its counterpart without the 
self-explaining nature, 
 achieving a new SOTA performance of {\bf 59.1} on SST-5 and 
  a new SOTA performance of {\bf 92.3} 
 on SNLI. \footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ShannonAI/Self_Explaining_Structures_Improve_NLP_Models}}

\section{Introduction} 
A long-term criticism against deep learning models is the lack of interpretability \cite{simonyan2013deep,bach2015lrp,montavon2017explaining,kindermans2017learning}. 
The black-box nature of neural models not only significantly limits the scope of applications of deep learning models (e.g., in  biomedical or legal domains), 
but also hinders model behavior analysis and error analysis. 

To enhance neural models' interpretability, various approaches to rationalize neural models' predictions have been proposed (details see Section \ref{related-work}). 
Existing interpretation models have two major drawbacks. Firstly, they are not self-explainable and require 
a  
 probing model  to be additionally built to interpret the original model. 
 Building the probing model is not only an additional burden, but more importantly, 
 the intrinsic decoupling nature of the two models makes  
 the probing model only able to provide approximate interpretation results. 
 Take the gradient-based saliency model \cite{simonyan2013deep,li2015visualizing,selvaraju2017grad} as an example, the  derivative of the target probability (or the logit) w.r.t. the input dimensions is only 
 an approximate feature weight 
  in the
  first-order Taylor expansion, with all higher  order items omitted. 

Secondly, interpretation models mostly focus on
learning 
 word-level importance scores assigned by the  the main model 
  and are hard to be adapted to higher-level text units such as phrases, sentences, or paragraphs. A straightforward way to compute the saliency score for a phrase or a sentence could be averaging the scores for its constituent words. 
Unfortunately, this over-simplified strategy is inadequate to capture the 
 semantic composition in language, which  
  involves multiple layers of highly non-linear operations in neural nets, and can thus result in high risk of misinterpretation. 
  As pointed by \newcite{murdoch2018beyond}, interpreting neural net predictions should go beyond word level. 

We raise the following question: {\bf what makes a good interpretation method for NLP?}
Firstly,  the method should be self-explainable and no additional probing model is needed.
Secondly, the model should offer precise and clear saliency scores for any level of text units. 
Thirdly, the self-explainable nature does not tradeoff performances.


Towards these three purposes, in this paper, we propose a self-explainable framework for deep neural models in the context of NLP. 
The key point of the proposed framework is to put an additional layer, as is called the {\it interpretation layer} on top of any existing NLP model,  
and this layer aggregates the information for all  (i.e., ) text spans. 
Each text span is  associated with a specific weight, and their weighted combination is fed to the softmax function for the final prediction. 
The proposed 
 structure offers  following advantages:
(1) the model is self-explainable: 
the interpretation layer is trained along with the objective, with no  probing model needed. 
 Weights at the interpretation layer can directly be used as saliency scores for  corresponding text spans; 
(2) since the saliency score for any text span can be straightforwardly derived from the interpretation layer,  
the model offers direct,  precise and clear saliency scores for any  level of text units beyond word level. 
 (3) the interpretation layer collects information for each text span in the form of representations, and forwards the weighted sum to the final prediction layer. 
Therefore, no additional information is incorporated, nor any information is lost at the interpretation layer. This makes the model not come at the cost of performances. 

The proposed framework is general, and can be adapted to any prevalent deep learning structure in NLP.
We show that the proposed framework (1) offers clear model interpretations; 
(2) facilitates error analysis; 
(3) can help   downstream NLP tasks such as adversarial example generation; and 
(4) most importantly, for the first time proves that self-explainable nature does not come at the cost of performances, but rather, 
leads to better results in NLP,  
 achieving a new SOTA performance of {\bf 59.1} on SST-5 and 
  a new SOTA performance of {\bf 92.3} 
 on SNLI.

\section{Related Work} 
\label{related-work}
Rationalizing model predictions is of growing interest \citep{ribeiro2016i,shrikumar2017learning,10.1371/journal.pone.0130140,kindermans2017learning,montavon2017explaining,schwab2019cxplain,arrieta2020explainable}.
In NLP, 
approaches to interpret neural models include 
 extracting 
pieces of input text, called ``rationales'', as justifications to model predictions  \citep{lei2016rationalizing,chang2019game,deyoung-etal-2020-eraser,jain-etal-2020-learning}, studying the 
efficacy and dynamics of hidden states in recurrent networks \citep{karpathy2015visualizing,shi-etal-2016-neural,greff2016lstm,strobelt2016visual}, and applying variants of the attention mechanism \citep{bahdanau2014neural} to interpret model behaviors \cite{jain2019attention,serrano2019attention,wiegreffe-pinter-2019-attention,vashishth2019attention,rogers2020primer}. 
\citet{lei2016rationalizing} proposed to extract text snippets as model explanations.
\citet{rajani2019explain} collected human rationales for commonsense reasoning.
Other works \citep{chen-etal-2019-seeing,lehman-etal-2019-inferring,chai2020description} trained independent models to extract supporting sentences as auxiliary guidelines for 
downstream tasks.
Using attentions as a tool for model interpretation, \citet{ghaeini2018interpreting} visualized attention heatmaps to understand how natural language inference models build interactions between two sentences;
\citet{vig2019analyzing,tenney2019bert,clark2019does,htut2019attention} analyzed the attention structures by plotting heatmaps, and found that meaningful linguistic patterns
exist in different heads and layers.
Despite the interpretability the attention mechanism offers, 
\newcite{serrano2019attention,jain2019attention} observed the highly inconsistency between attentions and predictors, and suggested that attentions
should not be treated as justification for a decision.

Saliency methods are widely used in  computer vision \citep{simonyan2013deep,zeiler2014visualizing,springenberg2014striving,adler2018auditing,datta2016algorithmic,srinivas2019full} and NLP \cite{denil2015extraction,li2015visualizing,li2016understanding,arras2016explaining,ebrahimi2017hotflip,feng2018pathologies,meng2020pair} for model interpretation. 
The key idea is to 
 find the  salient features responsible for a model's prediction.
 \citet{simonyan2013deep,srinivas2019full} visualized the contributions of input pixels by compute the derivatives of the label logit in the output layer with respect to the input pixel. 
 \citet{adler2018auditing,datta2016algorithmic} explained neural models by perturbing different  parts of the input, and compared the performance change in downstream tasks to measure the importance of perturbed features.
In the context of NLP,  \citet{denil2015extraction} used saliency maps to identify and extract task-specific salient sentences from documents to maximally preserve document topics and semantics; 
\citet{li2015visualizing} visualized word-level saliency maps to understand how individual words affect model predictions; \citet{ebrahimi2017hotflip} crafted white-box adversarial examples 
to find the most salient text-editing operations (flip, insertion and deletion) to trick models
by computing derivatives w.r.t. these editing operations; \citet{meng2020pair} combined the saliency method and the influence function \citep{koh2017understanding} to interpret model predictions from both learning history and inputs. 

 
  
Our work is inspired by \newcite{melis2018towards}, which achieves  ``self-explaining'' by jointly training a deep learning model and a linear regression model with human-interpretable features.
It is worth noting that the model in \newcite{melis2018towards} still requires a surrogate model, i.e., the  linear regression model with human-interpretable features. 
Instead, the proposed framework does not require a surrogate model. 
Our work is also inspired by \newcite{selvaraju2017grad} in computer vision, 
which 
computes the gradient  w.r.t.  feature maps of the high-level convolutional
layer to obtain high-level saliency scores. 

\section{The Self-Explaining Framework}
\subsection{Notations}
Given an input sequence , where  denotes the length of . 
Let  denote the text span starting at index , ending at index , where
. 
We wish to predict the label  for  based on .
Let  denote vocabulary size, and word representations are stored in .
The input  is associated with the label . 
\subsection{Model}
For illustration purposes, we use transformers \cite{vaswani2017attention} as the backbone to show how the proposed framework works. The framework can be easily extended to other models such as BiLSTMs or CNNs. An overview of the proposed model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:overview}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{overview.pdf}
    \caption{An overview of the proposed model.}
    \label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

{\bf Input Layer} Similar to standard deep learning models in NLP, the input layer for the proposed model consists of the stack of word representations for words in the input sequence, where  is represented as a -dimensional vector . 

{\bf Intermediate Layer}
On top of the input layer are the  encoder stacks, where each stack consists of multi-head attentions, layer normalization and residual connections. 
The representation for -th layer at position  is denoted by . 
Specially, the presentation for the last layer at position  is denoted by . 

{\bf Span Infor Collecting Layer (SIC)}
To enable direct measurement for saliency of an arbitrary text span, we place a Span Infor Collecting Layer on top of intermediate layer. 
For an arbitrary text span , we first obtain a dense representation  to represent , and  needs to contain all
semantic and syntactic 
 information stored in . 
Concretely,  is obtained by taking the representation for the starting index at the last intermediate layer , and the representation for the ending index :
 
where  denotes the mapping function, which be FFN or other forms.
The details of  will be discussed in section \ref{F}. The strategy of using the starting and ending representations to represent a text span has been used in many recent works on  span-level features in texts \cite{li2019unified,joshi2020spanbert,wu2019coreference}.
The SIC layer iterates over all text spans, and collects  for all , , with the complexity being . 


{\bf Interpretation Layer} The interpretation layer aggregates information from all text spans :
this is achieved by first 
 assigning weights  to each span  and combing these representations using weighted sum. The weight  
 can be obtained by first mapping  to a scalar, and then normalizing all : 

where . The output  from the  interpretation layer is the weighted average of all span representations:

{\bf Output Layer} Similar to the standard setup, the output layer of the proposed framework is the probability distribution over labels using the softmax function:

where . 
As can be seen,  measures how much  contributes to the final representation , and thus indicates 
 the importance of the text span . The proposed strategy is similar to gradient-based interpretation methods \cite{simonyan2013deep,li2015visualizing}. Using the chain rule, we have 
 
Omitting the second part,   is approximately in proportion to 
.
There is also a key advantage of the proposed framework over existing gradient-based interpretation methods, where 
the interpretation layer allows 
gradients to be straightforwardly computed with respect to an arbitrary text span. This is not feasible for vanilla gradient-based methods: 
because of the highly entanglement of neural networks, it's impossible to filter out the information of a specific text span 
from intermediate layers. Only gradients w.r.t. the input layer offers non-disentangling saliency scores, making the model only able to perform word-level explanations. 
\subsection{Efficient Computing}
\label{F}
A practical issue with Eq.\ref{combine} is the computation cost. If  takes the form of FFN, the computational complexity for one single text span is , 
leading to a final complexity of  if all spans are iterated over. This  is   computationally unaffordable for long texts. 
Towards efficient computations, we propose that  takes the following form:

where , .  denotes the pairwise dot between two vectors. Elements in 
 respectively captures concatenation, element-wise difference and element-wise closeness between the two vectors, the strategy of which is been used in recent work to model interactions between two semantic representations \cite{mou2015natural,seo2016bidirectional}.

In Eq.\ref{eff}, , ,  and  can be computed in advance for all  and , leading to a computational complexity of . 
For , it can be factorized as , with each of the two parts being computed in advance. 
 The final computational complexity of  is thus . The element-wise tanh operation for all  spans leads to a cost of , giving a complexity of  for  the SIC layer, which significantly cuts the cost.
 The computational cost for the interpretation layer, which requires the dot product between  and all , is also ,
 leading to the final  computational complexity . 
In this way, we reduce the computation cost from  to . 

\subsection{Training}
The training objective is the standard cross entropy loss. An additional regularization on  is needed:  
the model should only focus on 
 a very small number of text spans. We thus wish the distribution of  to be sharp. 
  We thus propose the following training objective:
 
which uses  as the regularizer. Under the constraint of ,  achieves the highest value with one element of  being 1 and the rest being 0, and the lowest value if all  have the same value.\footnote{Another regularization that can be used to fulfill the same purpose
of obtaining sharpening distributions 
 is the entropy  which can be viewed as the KL-divergence between the distribution and the uniform distribution. Empirically, we find that the two strategies perform almost the same.}
 The model  can be trained in an end-to-end fashion.
 \begin{comment}
  in two different ways: the end-to-end fashion and the pipelined fashion. 
For the former, we 
can directly train Eq.\ref{objective} in an end-to-end fashion, and use  for interpretation. 
For the latter,
we can  first train a model based on vanilla transformers, BiLSTMs or CNNs to optimize ,
 where the SIC layer and the interpretation layer are not used.
Next, we fix the input layer and the intermediate layers and only update parameters for the SIC layer and the interpretation layer based on Eq.\ref{objective}. 
\end{comment}
\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
\begin{comment}
Though  substantial efforts have been invested to neural model interpretations, 
there has not been a generally accepted 
framework for evaluating different  interpretation models. 
One direct way for evaluation is to ask humans to annotate rationales within the input text, and compare  rationales extracted by interpretation models with human annotations, as in \newcite{deyoung-etal-2020-eraser}. 
The biggest issue with this methodology is that in many NLP tasks (e.g., fine-grained sentiment analysis), the difference between different labels is subtle (e.g.,  positive label v.s. very positive label or negative v.s. very negative label). It is thus hard for humans to annotate rationales that are both {\bf sufficient} and {\bf comprehensive}. 
Therefore, tasks in \newcite{deyoung-etal-2020-eraser}  are mostly limited to relatively easy NLP tasks, e.g., binary sentiment classification where 
for most data point, 
identifying constituent sentiment keywords suffices for predictions. 
\end{comment}
We would like an automatic evaluation method that is both flexible in evaluating the quality of model explanations under any task and dataset, and able to offer the ability of accurately reflecting the {\it faithfulness} of model explanations, i.e., the extracted rationales ought to semantically influence the model's prediction for the same instance,  as suggested by \citet{deyoung-etal-2020-eraser}.

Intuitively,  if  extracted rationales can {\bf faithfully} represent, in other words, be equivalent to, 
 their corresponding text inputs with respect to model predictions, the following should hold: 
(1)  a model trained on the original inputs 
   should perform comparably well when tested on the extracted rationales; 
   (2)  a model trained on the extracted rationales should  perform comparably well when tested on the original inputs;
   (3) a model trained on the  extracted rationales should  perform comparably well when tested on other extracted rationales.  
Higher performances on these three aspects indicate more faithful extracted rationales, and consequently better interpretation models. 
These strategies are inspired by \newcite{lei2016rationalizing}, who trained a rationale generator to extract text pieces as explanations for different sentiment aspects for the task of sentiment analysis, achieving high precision based on  sentence-level aspect annotations. 
   
   More formally, we use 
 {\it full} to refer to the situation of training or testing a model
on the original texts, 
 and  {\it span} to refer to the situation of training or testing a model
on the extracted rationales.  
By denoting the original full dataset by ,  and , and the newly constructed rationale-based dataset by ,  and , the settings described above are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf FullTrain-SpanTest}: The model is trained on  and tested on , with hyperparameters selected on .
  \item {\bf SpanTrain-FullTest}: The model is trained on  and tested on , with hyperparameters selected on .
  \item {\bf SpanTrain-SpanTest}: The model is trained on  and tested on , with hyperparameters selected on .
\end{itemize}
To construct the new rationale-based dataset, we train a rationale-extraction model on  to extract rationales from the original text in ,  and , and then replace the original full input text with the corresponding extracted rationales, with the labels remaining unchanged.

It is also worthing that the proposed three evaluation metrics are far from perfect: the system can be gamed 
 if the extracted plan is just the same as the original span. The proposed evaluations thus need to be combined with other evaluations for complement.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Tasks and Datasets}
We conduct experiments on three NLP tasks: text classification on the SST-5 dataset \cite{socher2013recursive},
natural language inference on the SNLI dataset \cite{bowman2015large} 
and  machine translation on the IWSLT2014 EnDe dataset. 
Please refer to the appendix section for descriptions of the three datasets and training details. 



For text classification and natural language inference, we use RoBERT \citep{yinhan2019roberta}
as the model backbone.  
For reference purposes, we also train a self-explaining model with  set to be uniform, i.e., , where  is the total number of text spans. This model is denoted by AvgSelf-Explaining. 
For neural machine translation, we use the Transformer-base \citep{vaswani2017attention} model for evaluation.

\subsection{Main Results}
Table \ref{tab:main_results_1} shows the results for the SST-5 and SNLI datasets, and Table \ref{tab:main_results_2} shows the results for IWSLT 2014 EnDe. We can see from the tables that the proposed Self-Explaining method  significantly boosts performances over strong RoBERTa baselines on SST-5 and SNLI. 
Using RoBerta-large,  we
 achieve a new SOTA performance of {\bf 59.1} on SST-5 and 
  a new SOTA performance of {\bf 92.3} 
 on SNLI. 
A surprising observation is that in spite of using the SIC layer and the interpretation layer, AvgSelf-Explaining still underperforms RoBERTa, which indicates that  the learned attention weights  are important for model performances.


\subsection{Interpretability Evaluation}
We compare our proposed Self-Explaining model with the following three widely used interpretation models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf AvgGradient}: The method of averaging word saliency scores within a text span \citep{li2015visualizing,feng2018pathologies}.
    The saliency score of a word  is computed as the derivative of the probability of the ouput label with respect to the word embedding: , where  is the predicted probability of the ground-truth label ,  is the corresponding word embedding of word  and  is the L1 norm. We take the average of saliency scores of all words within a text span as the span-level saliency score. We select the span with the highest span-level saliency score as the rationale.
    \item {\bf AvgAttention}: The method of averaging attention scores within a text span \citep{vig2019analyzing,tenney2019bert,clark2019does}. The attention score for each word  is the normalized attentive probability of the special token \texttt{[CLS]} with respect to
    word
      in the last intermediate layer. We take the average of attention scores of all words within a text span as the span-level attention score. The span with the highest 
     span-level 
     attention score is selected as the rationale.
    \item {\bf Rationale}: The rationale extraction model proposed by \citet{lei2016rationalizing}. One encoder is used to encode input texts into representative features, and one generator is used to extract text spans as rationales. These two models are jointly trained to minimize the expected cost function using the REINFORCE algorithm \citep{DBLP:journals/ml/Williams92}.

\end{itemize}
All models use RoBERTa \citep{yinhan2019roberta} as the backbone and are trained separately for comparison.

Results are shown in Table \ref{tab:evaluation}. For all the three setups FullTrain-SpanTest, SpanTrain-FullTest and SpanTrain-SpanTest, we can observe that the proposed Self-Explaining outperforms other interpretation methods by a large margin on both SST-5 and SNLI. On SST, Self-Explaining outperforms Rationale by +3.2, +5.0 and +6.7 respectively for the F-S, S-F and S-S setup. On SNLI, Self-Explaining outperforms Rationale by +3.5, +10.0 and 7.3 respectively for the F-S, S-F and S-S setup. 
Comparing AvgGradient, AvgAttention and Rationale, we can see that there is no method that shows consistent  superiority to the other two. For example, Rationale outperforms AvgGradient and AvgAttention under the F-S and S-F setup, but underperforms AvgGradient under the S-S setup. Instead, Self-Explaining consistently achieves significantly better results compared to all baselines  under all setups.
These results demonstrate the better interpretability of the proposed Self-Explaining method.

\subsection{Evaluation on ERASER}
We also evaluate interpretability performances of different models on the ERASER dataset \citep{deyoung-etal-2020-eraser}. 
Evaluations are conducted on the 
Movie Review dataset and SNLI dataset in ERASER.  
Since the dataset is labeled in a way that an input can contain multiple rationales, we treat the threshold for  as the hyper-parameter to be tuned on the dev sets of ERASER.
Spans with  higher than the threshold will be selected. To deal with the issue of overlapping spans, we adopt the following strategy: we select spans in a top-down fashion, and the current span will be ignored if it overlaps with previously selected spans. 
We compared the extracted spans with the golden labeled spans and report  IOU F1 and token F1 scores. 
Results are shown in Table \ref{tab:eraser}. Performances on both the Movie Review and the SNLI datasets exhibit significant improvements of Self-Explaining over other baselines, demonstrating the stronger ability of extracting rationales of the proposed Self-Explaining method.

\subsection{The Effect of }
We would like to explore the effect of  in the additional regularization term in Eq.\ref{objective}. A larger  has a stronger effect on sharpening the distribution of , leading to the preference to a small fraction of text spans. Intuitively, a reasonable value of  is crucial for model performances: too small   means the selected text spans are not confident enough to support model predictions, while too large  means the model only attends to a single text span for its prediction. The former may cause  over-numbered selected text spans, which incurs more noise for model predictions. The latter may force the model the attend to a single span that is not important for predictions. Therefore, a sensible  should be neither too small nor too large, balancing the number of attended text spans.

Figure \ref{fig:lambda} shows the results. As we can see from the figure,  leads to the best result on SST-5 and  gives the best result on SNLI, significantly outperforming models with small  and large , as well as the baseline. As the value of  keeps increasing, the performance drastically drops. When  for SST-5 and  for SNLI, the accuracies are respectively 56.4 and 90.3, even underperforming baselines without self-explaining structures. 
To our surprise, though the model performance with  is worse than the best model with  and , it still achieves better results compared to baselines (57.0 vs. 56.4 on SST-5 and 91.4 vs. 90.7 on SNLI). This observation verifies that the proposed method can actually improve NLP models in terms of both performance and interpretability.

\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Examples}
Table \ref{tab:example} lists several examples to illustrate how different  methods extract text spans to interpret model predictions. Extracted spans are in bold. 

As can be seen from the table, all methods including Self-Explaining are able to extract corresponding text spans as evidential explanation for the model prediction. For example, both AvgAttention and the proposed Self-Explaining are able to extract ``overproduced and generally disappointing'' as rationale for predicting the label {\it Very Negative}, and AvgGradient selects the key term ``disappointing'', which also makes sense in this case.
However, compared to AvgGradient and AvgAttention, Self-Explaining can select more global and comprehensive text spans. For example, Self-Explaining extracts ``it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with Stevenson’s tale'' for predicting the {\it Negative} label, while AvgAttention and AvgGradient only extract ``lacks grandeur'', which may not be comprehensive for making the decision. Self-Explaining is able to extract ``Though everything might be literate and smart'' as rationale for predicting {\it Negative}, while AvgAttention and AvgGradient only extract local text spans ``smart'' and ``literate and smart'',  respectively. Although they all  make correct predictions, the rationales provided by  AvgAttention and AvgGradient can not explain their behaviors of making the decision. By contrast, Self-Explaining successfully captures the conjunction ``though'', a word that  reverses the sentiment from positive to negative.


\subsection{Error Analysis}
By examining extracted text spans from erroneously classified examples, 
the model provides a direct way for performing error analysis.
The biggest advantage of the proposed model over previous interpretability methods is that, instead of  focusing merely on word-level features as in \citet{li2015visualizing,li2016understanding},
the proposed model operates at arbitrary levels of text units, providing more direct and accurate views of why models make mistakes. 
 By examining erroneously classified examples shown in Table \ref{tab:error}, 
we can clearly identify 
a few patterns that make neural models fail: 
(1) the model 
emphasizes the  part of sentences that should not be attended to in the 
contrast conjunction, e.g., ``
[the story is naturally poignant], but first - time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business'';
(2) the model cannot recognize  a word used in a context that changes its sentiment, e.g., ``
[a well acted and well intention] ed snoozer'' and ``There [isn't a weak or careless performance] amongst them'';
(3) the model cannot recognize irony: 
``george, [hire a real director] and good writers for the next installment, please''; (4) the model cannot recognize analogy: ``It's [like a poem]'', etc.

\subsection{Span-based Adversarial Example Generation}
There has been a growing interest in generating adversarial examples to attack a neural network model in NLP \citep{alzantot2018generating,ren-etal-2019-generating,zhang2020adversarial}. 
The current  protocol for adversarial example generation is based on word substitution \citep{liang2017deep,ebrahimi2017hotflip,samanta2017towards,ren-etal-2019-generating}, where an important word is  selected by saliency  and then 
replaced by its synonym if the replacement can flip the prediction. 
The shortcoming for current approaches is that it can only operate at the word level and perform word-level substitutions. This is rooted in the fact that 
 saliency scores can only be reliably computed at the word level.

The proposed span-based model naturally addresses this issue: 
we  first  identify the most salient span in the input based on , replace it with its paraphrase if the replacement flips the label.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first feasible approach that operates at higher levels beyond words for adversarial example generation in NLP. 
Paraphrases are generated by 
back-translation \citep{sennrich2016back-translation,edunov2018understanding}.\footnote{We use the 
off-the-shelf google translator to implement EnDeEn back-translation.} 

Following \citet{ren-etal-2019-generating}, 
we use two datasets for test, IMDB \citep{maas2011learning} and Yahoo! Answers.
The details of the two datasets are described in Appendix. 
For fair comparisons, we follow \citet{ren-etal-2019-generating} to use the Bi-LSTMs as the model backbone and compare our proposed Self-Explaining+Paraphrase model with the following attacking methods: (1) Random; (2) {Gradient}; (3) {Traversing in Word Order (TiWO)}; (4) {Word Saliency (WS)}; (5) Probability Weighted Word Saliency (PWWS). We refer readers to  \citet{ren-etal-2019-generating} for more details of these methods.

Table \ref{tab:adversarial} shows the classification accuracies of different methods on the original datasets and the adversarial samples generated by these attacking methods. 
Results show that our proposed Self-Explaining+Paraphrase method reduces the classification accuracy to the most extent. Compared to the original performance, Self-Explaining+Paraphrase reduces the classification accuracies on IMDB and Yahoo! Answers by 84\% and 48.86\%, respectively, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed Self-Explaining+Paraphrase method for generating adversarial samples.

Table \ref{tab:adversarial_example} gives two examples of flipping model predictions by using the Self-Explaining+Paraphrase method to generate adversarial text spans. Through the examples, we can see that the selected text span is crucial for the model prediction and a slight perturbation injected to this span would flip the prediction.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present a light but effective self-explainable structure to improve both performance and interpretability in the context of NLP.  The idea of the proposed method is to introduce an interpretation layer, aggregating information for each text span, which is then assigned a specific weight representing its contribution to interpreting  the model prediction. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of improving performances for the task of sentiment classification and natural language inference, as well as endowing the model with the ability of self-explaining, avoiding heavy recourse to additional external interpretation models such as probing models and surrogate models.

\section{Datasets and Training Details}
The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) \citep{socher2013recursive} is a widely used benchmark for text classification. The task is to perform both fine-grained (very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very negative) and coarse-grained (positive and negative) sentiment classification at both the phrase and sentence level. We adopt the fine-grained setup in this work. We use Adam \citep{kingma2014adam} to optimize all modesl, with . All hyperparameters including batch size, dropout and learning rate are tuned on the validation set.

The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus \citep{bowman2015large} is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs for the task of natural language inference (NLI). It contains a balanced amount of sentence pairs with  labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral. We follow the official train/dev/test splits for both datasets. We also use Adam \citep{kingma2014adam} for optimization. 
Hyperparameters including batch size, dropout and learning rate are tuned on the validation set 



IWSLT2014 EnDe contains 160k training sequences pairs and 7k validation sentence pairs. We use the concatenation of dev2010, tst2010, tst2011 and tst2011 as the test set. A joint BPE vocabulary of about 10k tokens is constructed.  
We minimize the cross entropy loss with label smoothing of value 0.1 during training.  Adam \citep{kingma2014adam} is used for optimization.

IMDB contains an even number of positive and negative reviews. The training and test sets  respectively contain 25k and 25k examples.
Yahoo! Answers is a large dataset for topic classification over ten largest main categories from Yahoo! Answers Comprehensive Questions and Answers v1.0. This dataset contains 1,400k training exmaples and 60k test examples respectively.
