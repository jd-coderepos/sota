\begin{abstract}
This paper presents small world in motion (SWIM), a new mobility model for ad-hoc networking. SWIM is relatively simple, is easily tuned by setting just a few parameters, and generates traces that look real---synthetic traces have the same statistical properties of real traces. SWIM shows experimentally and theoretically the presence of the power law and exponential decay dichotomy of inter-contact time, and, most importantly, our experiments show that it can predict very accurately the performance of forwarding protocols.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Mobile ad-hoc networking has presented many challenges to the research community,
especially in designing suitable, efficient, and well performing protocols.
The practical analysis and validation of such protocols often depends on
synthetic data, generated by some mobility model. The model has the goal of
simulating real life scenarios~\cite{camp02wcmc} that can be used to tune
networking protocols and to evaluate their performance. A lot of work has been
done in designing realistic mobility models. Till a few years ago, the model of
choice in academic research was the random way point mobility model
(RWP)~\cite{rwp}, simple and very efficient to use in simulations.

Recently, with the aim of understanding human mobility~\cite{toronto, hui05,
hui06, milan07, UCAM-CL-TR-617}, many researchers have performed
real-life experiments by distributing wireless devices to people. From the data
gathered during the experiments, they have observed the typical distribution of
metrics such as inter-contact time (time interval between two successive
contacts of the same people) and contact duration. Inter-contact time, which
corresponds to how often people see each other, characterizes the opportunities
of packet forwarding between nodes. Contact duration, which limits the duration
of each meeting between people in mobile networks, limits the amount of data
that can be transferred.
In~\cite{hui05, hui06}, the authors show that the distribution of
inter-contact time is a power-law. Later, in~\cite{milan07}, it has been
observed that the distribution of inter-contact time is best described as a
power law in a first interval on the time scale (12 hours, in the experiments
under analysis), then truncated by an exponential cut-off. Conversely,
\cite{cai07mobicom} proves that RWP yields exponential inter-contact time
distribution. Therefore, it has been established clearly that models like RWP
are not good to simulate human mobility, raising the need of new, more realistic
mobility models for mobile ad-hoc networking.

In this paper we present small world in motion (SWIM), a simple mobility model that generates small worlds. The model is very simple to implement and very efficient in simulations. The mobility pattern of the nodes is based on a simple intuition on human mobility: People go more often to places not very far from their home and where they can meet a lot of other people. By implementing this simple rule, SWIM is able to raise social behavior among nodes, which we believe to be the base of human mobility in real life.
We validate our model using real traces and compare the distribution of inter-contact time, contact duration and number of contact distributions between nodes, showing that synthetic data that we generate match very well real data traces.
Furthermore, we show that SWIM can predict well the performance of forwarding protocols. We compare the performance of two forwarding protocols---epidemic forwarding~\cite{vahdat00epidemic} and (a simplified version of) delegation forwarding~\cite{dfw08}---on both real traces and synthetic traces generated with SWIM. The performance of the two protocols on the synthetic traces accurately approximates their performance on real traces, supporting the claim that SWIM is an excellent model for human mobility.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork} briefly reports on current work in the field; in Section~\ref{sec:solution} we present the details of SWIM and we prove theoretically that the distribution of inter-contact time in SWIM has an exponential tail, as recently observed in real life experiments; Section~\ref{sec:experiments} compares synthetic data traces to real traces and shows that the distribution of inter-contact time has a head that decays as a power law, again like in real experiments;
in Section~\ref{sec:forwarding} we show our experimental results on the behavior of two forwarding protocols on both synthetic and real traces; lastly, Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} present some concluding remarks.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

The mobility model recently presented in~\cite{levy} generates movement traces
using a model which is similar to a random walk, except that the flight lengths
and the pause times in destinations are generated based on Levy Walks, so with
power law distribution. In the past, Levy Walks have been shown to approximate
well the movements of animals. The model produces inter-contact time
distributions similar to real world traces. However, since every node moves
independently, the model does not capture any social behavior between nodes.
In~\cite{musolesi07}, the authors present a mobility model based on social
network theory which takes in input a social network and discuss the community
patterns and groups distribution in geographical terms. They validate their
synthetic data with real traces and show a good matching between them.

The work in \cite{LCA-CONF-2008-049} presents a new mobility model for clustered networks. Moreover, a closed-form expression for the stationary distribution of node position is given. The model captures the phenomenon of emerging clusters, observed in real partitioned networks, and correlation between the spatial speed distribution and the cluster formation.

In~\cite{workingDay}, the authors present a mobility model that simulates the every day life of people that go to their work-places in the morning, spend their day at work and go back to their homes at evenings. Each one of this scenarios is a simulation per se. The synthetic data they generate match well the distribution of inter-contact time and contact durations of real traces.

In a very recent work, Barabasi et al.~\cite{barabasi08} study the trajectory of
a very large (100,000) number of anonymized mobile phone users whose position is
tracked for a six-months period. They observe that human trajectories show a
high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being
characterized by a time independent characteristic travel distance and a
significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. They
also show that the probability density function of individual travel distances
are heavy tailed and also are different for different groups of users and
similar inside each group. Furthermore, they plot also the frequency of visiting
different locations and show that it is well approximated by a power law. All
these observations are in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by
Levy flight and random walk models, and support the intuition behind SWIM.

\section{Small World in Motion}
\label{sec:solution}

We believe that a good mobility model should
\begin{enumerate}
	\item be simple; and
	\item predict well the performance of networking protocols on real mobile
	networks.
\end{enumerate}
We can't overestimate the importance of having a \emph{simple} model. A simple
model is easier to understand, can be useful to distill the fundamental
ingredients of ``human'' mobility, can be easier to implement, easier to tune
(just one or few parameters), and can be useful to support theoretical work. We
are also looking for a model that generates traces with the same statistical
properties that real traces have. Statistical distribution of inter-contact time
and number of contacts, among others, are useful to characterize the behavior of
a mobile network. A model that generates traces with statistical properties that
are far from those of real traces is probably useless. Lastly, and most
importantly, a model should be accurate in predicting the performance of network
protocols on real networks. If a protocol performs well (or bad) in the model,
it should also perform well (or bad) in a real network. As accurately as
possible.

None of the mobility models in the literature meets all of these properties. The random way-point mobility model is simple, but its traces do not look real at all (and has a few other problems). Some of the other protocols we reviewed in the related work section can indeed produce traces that look real, at least with respect to some of the possible metrics, but are far from being simple. And, as far as we know, no model has been shown to predict real world performance of protocols accurately.

Here, we propose \emph{small world in motion} (SWIM), a very simple mobility
model that meets all of the above requirements. Our model is based on a couple
of simple rules that are enough to make the typical  properties of real traces
emerge, just naturally. We will also show that this model can predict the
performance of networking protocols on real mobile networks extremely well.

\subsection{The intuition}

When deciding where to move, humans usually trade-off. The best supermarket or the most popular restaurant that are also not far from where they live, for example. It is unlikely (though not impossible) that we go to a place that is far from home, or that is not so popular, or interesting. Not only that, usually there are just a few places where a person spends a long period of time (for example home and work office or school), whereas there are lots of places where she stays less, like for example post office, bank, cafeteria, etc. These are the basic intuitions SWIM is built upon. Of course, trade-offs humans face in their everyday life are usually much more complicated, and there are plenty of unknown factors that influence mobility. However, we will see that simple rules---trading-off proximity and popularity, and distribution of waiting time---are enough to get a mobility model with a number of desirable properties and an excellent capability of predicting the performance of forwarding protocols.

\subsection{The model in details}

More in detail, to each node is assigned a so called \emph{home}, which is a
randomly and uniformly chosen point over the network area. Then, the node itself
assigns to each possible destination a \emph{weight} that grows with the
popularity of the place and decreases with the distance from home. The weight
represents the probability for the node to chose that place as its next
destination.

At the beginning, no node has been anywhere. Therefore, nodes do not know how
popular destinations are. The number of other nodes seen in each destination is
zero and this information is updated each time a node reaches a destination.
Since the domain is continuous, we divided the network area into many small
contiguous cells that represent possible destinations. Each cell has a squared
area, and its size depends on the transmitting range of the nodes. Once a node
reaches a cell, it should be able to communicate with every other node that is
in the same cell at the same time. Hence, the size of the cell is such that its
diagonal is equal to the transmitting radius of the nodes. Based on this, each
node can easily build a \emph{map} of the network area, and can also calculate
the weight for each cell in the map. These information will be used to
determine the next destination: The node chooses its cell
destination randomly and proportionally with its weight, whereas the exact
destination point (remind that the network area is continuous) is taken
uniformly at random over the cell's area. Note that,
according to our experiments, it is not really necessary that the node has a
\emph{full} map of the domain. It can remember just the most popular cells it
has visited and assume that everywhere else there is nobody (until, by chance,
it chooses one of these places as destination and learn that they are indeed
popular). The general properties of SWIM holds as well.

Once a node has chosen its next destination, it starts moving towards it
following a straight line and with a speed that is proportional to the distance
between the starting point and the destination. To keep things simple, in the
simulator the node chooses as its speed value exactly the distance between these
two points. The speed remains constant till the node reaches the destination. In
particular, that means that nodes finish each leg of their movements in constant
time. This can seem quite an oversimplification, however, it is useful and also
not far from reality. Useful to simplify the model; not far from reality since
we are used to move slowly (maybe walking) when the destination is nearby,
faster when it is farther, and extremely fast (maybe by car) when the
destination is far-off.

More specifically, let  be one of the nodes and  its home. Let also 
be one of the possible destination cells. We will denote with 
the number of nodes that node~ encountered in  the last time it reached
. As we already mentioned, this number is  at the beginning of the
simulation and it is updated each time node~ reaches a destination in
cell~. Since  is a point, whereas  is a cell, when calculating the
distance of  from its home , node~ refers to the center of the cell's
area. In our case, being the cell a square, its center is the mid diagonal
point. The weight that node~ assigns to cell  is as follows:

where  is a function that decays as a power law as
the distance between node~ and cell~ increases.

In the above equation  is a constant in . Since the weight that a
node assigns to a place represents the probability that the node chooses it as
its next destination, the value of  has a strong effect on the node's
decisions---the larger is , the more the node will tend to go to places
near its home. The smaller is , the more the node will tend to go to
``popular'' places. Even if it goes beyond our scope in this paper, we strongly
believe that would be interesting to exploit consequences of using different
values for . We do think that both small and big values for 
rise clustering effect of the nodes. In the first case, the clustering effect
is based on the neighborhood locality of the nodes, and is more related to a
social type: Nodes that ``live'' near each other should tend to frequent the
same places, and therefore tend to be ``friends''. In the second case, instead,
the clustering effect should raise as a consequence of the popularity of the
places.

When reaching destination the node decides how long to remain there. One of the
key observations is that in real life a person usually stays for a long time
only in a few places, whereas there are many places where he spends a short
period of time. Therefore, the distribution of the waiting time should follow a
power law. However, this is in contrast with the experimental evidence that
inter-contact time has an exponential cut-off, and with the intuition that, in
many practical scenarios, we won't spend more than a few hours standing at the
same place (our goal is to model day time mobility). So, SWIM uses an upper
bounded power law distribution for waiting time, that is, a truncated power law.
Experimentally, this seems to be the correct choice.

\subsection{Power law and exponential decay dichotomy}

In a recent work~\cite{milan07}, it is observed that the distribution of
inter-contact time in real life experiments shows a so  called dichotomy: First
a power law until a certain point in time, then an exponential cut-off.
In~\cite{cai07mobicom}, the authors suggest that the exponential cut-off is due
to the bounded domain where nodes move. In SWIM, inter-contact time distribution
shows exactly the same dichotomy. More than that, our experiments show that, if
the model is properly tuned, the distribution is strikingly similar to that of
real life experiments.

We show here, with a mathematically rigorous proof, that the distribution of
inter-contact time of nodes in SWIM has an exponential
tail. Later, we will see experimentally that the same distribution has indeed
a head distributed as a power law. Note that the proof has to cope with a
difficulty due to the social nature of SWIM---every decision taken in SWIM by a
node \emph{not} only depends on its own previous decisions, but also depends on
other nodes' decisions: Where a node goes now, strongly affects where it
will choose to go in the future, and, it will affect also where other
nodes will chose to go in the future. So, in SWIM there are no renewal
intervals, decisions influence future decisions of other nodes, and nodes never
``forget'' their past.

In the following, we will consider two nodes  and . Let , ,
be the position of node~ at time~. Similarly,  is the position of
node~ at time~. We assume that at time~ the two nodes are leaving
visibility after meeting. That is, ,  for
, and  for . Here,  is the
euclidean distance in the square. The inter-contact time of nodes  and 
is defined as:

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass:lower}
For all nodes~ and for all cells~, the distance function 
returns at least .
\end{assumption}

\begin{theorem}
If  and under Assumption~\ref{ass:lower}, \emph{the tail} of the
inter-contact time distribution between nodes~ and~ in SWIM has an
exponential decay.
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
To prove the presence of the exponential cut-off, we will show that there exists
constant  such that

for all sufficiently large . Let , , be
a sequence of times. Constant  is large enough that each node has
to make a way point decision in the interval between  and 
and that each node has enough time to finish a leg. Recall that this is of
course possible since waiting time at way points is bounded above and since
nodes complete each leg of movement in constant time. The idea is to take
snapshots of nodes  and  and see whether they see each other at each
snapshot. However, in the following, we also need that at least one of the two
nodes is not moving at each snapshot. So, let

Clearly, , for all .

We take the sequence of snapshots . Let  be the event that nodes  and  are not in visibility range at time . We have that

Consider . At
time~, at least one of the two nodes is at a way point, by
definition of . Say node~, without loss of generality. Assume that
node~ is in cell  (either moving or at a way point). During its last way
point decision, node~ has chosen cell  as its next way point with
probability at least , thanks to Assumption~\ref{ass:lower}. If
this is the case, the two nodes~ and~ are now in visibility. Note that the
decision has been made after the previous snapshot, and that it is not
independent of previous decisions taken by node~, and it is not even
independent of previous decisions taken by node~ (since the social nature of
decisions in SWIM). Nonetheless, with probability at least  the two
nodes are now in visibility. Therefore,

So,

for sufficiently large .
\end{IEEEproof}

where  is the position of the home of the current node, and  is the
position of the center of cell~. Positions are coordinates in the square of
size 1. Constant  is a scaling factor, set to , which accounts for the
small size of the experiment area. Note that function 
decays as a power law. We come up with this choice after a large set of
experiments, and the choice is heavily influenced by scaling factors.

We start with Infocom~05. The number of nodes  and the simulation time are
the same as in the real data set, hence 41 and 3 days respectively. Since the
area of the real experiment was quite small (a large hotel), we deem that
 can be a good approximation of the real scenario. In
Infocom~05, there were many parallel sessions. Typically, in such a case one
chooses to follow what is more interesting to him. Hence, people with the same
interests are more likely to meet each other. In this experiment, the parameter
 such that the output fit best the real traces is . The
results of this experiment are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:infocom}.

We continue with the Cambridge scenario. The number of nodes and the simulation
time are the same as in the real data set, hence 11 and 5 days respectively. In
the Cambridge data set, the iMotes were distributed to two groups of students,
mainly undergrad year~1 and~ 2, and also to some PhD and Master students.
Obviously, students of the same year are more likely to see each other more
often. In this case, the parameter  which best fits the real traces is
. This choice proves to be fine for both Cambridge~05 and
Cambridge~06. The results of this experiment are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:cambridge05} and~\ref{fig:cambridge06}.

In all of the three experiments, SWIM proves to be an excellent way to generate
synthetic traces that approximate real traces. It is particularly interesting
that the same choice of parameters gets goods results for all the metrics under
consideration at the same time.

\section{Comparative performance of forwarding protocols}

\caption{Performance of both forwarding protocols on real traces and SWIM
traces. EFw denotes Epidemic Forwarding while DFwd Delegation Forwarding.}
\label{fig:performance}
\end{figure*}

In this section we show other experimental results of SWIM, related to
evaluation of two simple forwarding protocols for DNTs such as Epidemic
Forwarding~\cite{vahdat00epidemic} and simplified version of Delegation
Forwarding\cite{dfw08} in which each node has a random constant as its quality.
Of course, this simplified version of delegation forwarding is not very
interesting and surely non particularly efficient. However, we use it just as a
worst case benchmark against epidemic forwarding, with the understanding that
our goal is just to validate the quality of SWIM, and not the quality of the
forwarding protocol.

In the following experiments, we use for each experiment the same tuning used
in the previous section. That is, the parameters input to SWIM are not
``optimized'' for each of the forwarding protocols, they are just the same that
has been used to fit real traces with synthetic traces.

For the evaluation of the two forwarding protocols we use the same assumptions
and the same way of generating traffic to be routed as in~\cite{dfw08}.
For each trace and forwarding protocol a set of messages is generated with
sources and destinations chosen uniformly at random, and generation times form a
Poisson process averaging one message per 4 seconds.
The nodes are assumed to have infinite buffers and carry all message replicas
they receive until the end of the simulation. The metrics we are concerned with
are: \emph{cost}, which is the number of replicas per generated message;
\emph{success rate} which is the fraction of generated messages for which at
least one replica is delivered; \emph{average delay} which is the average
duration per delivered message from its generation time to the first arrival of
one of its replicas.
As in \cite{dfw08} we isolated 3-hour periods for each data trace (real and
synthetic) for our study. Each simulation runs therefore 3 hours. to avoid
end-effects no messages were generated in the last hour of each trace.

In the two forwarding protocols, upon contact with node , node  decides
which message from its message queue to forward in the following way:
\begin{trivlist}
\item
\textbf{Epidemic Forwarding:} Node  forwards message~ to node  unless
 already has a replica of . This protocol achieves the best possible
performance, so it yields upper bounds on success rate and average delay.
However, it does also have a high cost.
\item
\textbf{(Simplified) Delegation Forwarding:} To each node is initially given a
quality, distributed uniformly in . To each message is given a rate,
which, in every instant corresponds to the quality of the node with the best
quality that message have seen so far. When generated the message inherits the
rate from the node that generates it (that would be the sender for that
message). Node  forwards message  to node  if the quality of node 
is greater than the rate of the copy of  that  holds. If  is forwarded
to , both nodes  and  update the rate of their copy of  to the
quality of .
\end{trivlist}

Figure~\ref{fig:forwarding} shows how the two forwarding protocols perform in
both real and synthetic traces, generated with SWIM.
As you can see, the results are excellent---SWIM predicts very accurately the
performance of both protocols. Most importantly, this is not due to a customized
tuning that has been optimized for these forwarding protocols, it is just the
same output that SWIM has generated with the tuning of the previous section.
This can be important methodologically: To tune SWIM on a particular scenario,
you can concentrate on a few well known and important statistical properties
like inter-contact time, number of contacts, and duration of contacts. Then, you
can have a good confidence that the model is properly tuned and usable to get
meaningful estimation of the performance of a forwarding protocol.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper we present SWIM, a new mobility model for ad hoc networking. SWIM
is simple, proves to generate traces that look real, and provides an accurate
estimation of forwarding protocols in real mobile networks. SWIM can be used to
improve our understanding of human mobility, and it can support theoretical work
and it can be very useful to evaluate the performance of networking protocols in
scenarios that scales up to very large mobile systems, for which we don't have
real traces.
