Learning powerful data embeddings has become a center piece in machine learning,  especially in natural language processing  and computer vision  domains. The crux of these embeddings is that they are pretrained  on huge corpus of data in a unsupervised fashion, sometimes aided with transfer learning. However currently in the graph learning domain, embeddings learned through existing graph  neural networks (GNNs) are  task dependent and  thus cannot be shared across different datasets. In this paper, we present a  first powerful and theoretically guaranteed graph neural network that is designed to learn {\em task-independent} graph embeddings,  thereafter referred to as {\em deep  universal graph embedding} (\textsc{DUGnn}). Our \textsc{DUGnn}  model 
incorporates a novel graph neural network (as a universal graph encoder) and leverages rich Graph Kernels (as a multi-task graph decoder) for both unsupervised learning and (task-specific) adaptive supervised learning. 
By learning task-independent graph embeddings across diverse datasets, \textsc{DUGnn} also reaps the benefits of transfer learning. 
Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that the proposed \textsc{DUGnn}  model consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-art GNN models and Graph Kernels by an increased accuracy of  on graph classification benchmark datasets.

\section{Introduction}

Learning powerful data embeddings   has become a center piece in machine learning for producing superior results. This new trend of learning embeddings from data can be attributed to the  huge success  of word2vec~\cite{mikolov2013distributed, pennington2014glove}  with unprecedented  real-world performance in natural language processing (NLP). The importance of  extracting high quality  embeddings has now been  realized   in many other domains such as computer vision (CV)  and recommendation systems~\cite{kiela2014learning, karpathy2014deep, zhang2016collaborative}. The crux of these embeddings is that they are  pretrained  in an unsupervised fashion on huge amount of data  and thus can potentially capture all kind of contextual information. Such embedding learning is further advanced by the incorporation of multi-task learning and transfer learning which allow more generalized embeddings to be learned across different datasets. These developments have brought major breakthroughs in NLP: DecaNLP~\cite{mccann2018natural} and BERT~\cite{devlin2018bert} are  recent such prime examples. 

Besides natural languages (``sequence'' or 1D data) and images (2D or 3D) which are well-structured, the idea of embedding learning has been applied to (irregular) ``graph-structured'' data for various graph learning tasks, such as node classification or link prediction. Unlike word embeddings where vocabulary is typically finite, graph ``vocabulary'' is potentially infinite (i.e, count of non-isomorphic graphs). Hence learning {\em contextua}l based embeddings, {\em a la}  ELMo~\cite{peters2018deep}  namely, is crucial. Building upon the success of deep learning in images and words, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been recently developed for various graph learning tasks on graph-structured datasets. Most of existing GNNs are {\em task-specific} in the sense that   they are trained on datasets via supervised (or semi-supervised)  learning with task-specific labels, and thus the trained models cannot be directly applied to other tasks. In addition, they are often limited to learning {\em node embeddings}  	  (based on a node's local structure within an underlying graph), as opposed to {\em graph embedding} (defined as a single embedding for the whole graph), which is more general purpose, e.g.,  for graph classification or graph generation tasks. Besides graph embedding can \emph{serve as a node embedding} by operating on node's ego-graph.

We envision a {\em deep universal graph  embedding neural network} (\textsc{DUGnn})	, which is  capable of the following: 1) It can be trained on diverse datasets (e.g., with different node features) for a variety of tasks in an {\em unsupervised} fashion to learn  {\em task-independent} graph embeddings; 2) The learned graph embedding model can be shared across different datasets, thus enjoying the benefits of   transfer learning; 3) The learned model can  further be adapted and improved for specific tasks using adaptive supervised learning.  Figure~\ref{fig:transfer} shows some sample graphs in four different real-world datasets from fields as diverse as bioinformatics and quantum mechanics. While the node features (and their meanings) can differ vastly but the underlying graphs governing them contain isomorphic graph structures. This   suggests that learning universal graph embeddings across diverse datasets is not only possible, but can potentially offer the benefits of transfer learning. From \emph{theoretical} point of view, we establishes the \emph{generalization guarantee} of  \textsc{DUGnn} model for graph classification task and discuss the \emph{role of transfer learning} in helping towards reducing the generalization gap. \emph{To best of our knowledge}, we are the first to propose doing \emph{transfer learning}    in the graph neural network domain.

In order to develop a universal graph embedding model, we need to overcome three main technical challenges.  Firstly, existing GNNs  operate at the {\em node feature-matrix} level.
Unlike images or words where the channels or embedding layer has a fixed input size,  in the context of graph learning, the initial node feature (a feature vector defined on nodes in a graph)   dimension can vary across different datasets. Secondly, the model complexity of GNNs is often  limited by the basic graph convolution operation, which in its purest form is the aggregation of neighboring node features and may suffer from the Laplacian smoothing problem~\cite{li2018deeper}. Lastly, the major technical hurdle is to devise an {\em unsupervised graph decoder} that is capable of regenerating or reconstructing the original graph directly from its graph embedding with minimal loss of information. 





We propose a \textsc{DUGnn} model   to tackle these challenges  with three carefully designed core components: 1) {\em Input Transformer}, 2) {\em Universal Graph Encoder}, and   3) {\em Multi-Task Graph Decoder}. 
Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that the   \textsc{DUGnn}  model consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-art GNN models and Graph Kernels by an increased accuracy of  on  graph classification benchmark datasets.

\section{Related Work}~\label{sec:related_work}
\vspace{-2.5em}

Recently, various graph neural networks (viewed as   ``graph encoders'')   have been developed, in particular, learning task-specific node embeddings from graph-structured datasets. In contrast, we are interested in learning task-independent graph embedding. Furthermore, our problem also involves designing graph decoder -- graph reconstruction using    graph embedding -- which is far more challenging and  has not received much attention in the literature.  We overview the key related in these two areas along with graph kernels.  

\textbf{Graph Encoders and Decoders}: Under graph encoders, we consider both graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) and  message passing neural networks (MPNNs).  The early development of GNNs can be traced back to graph signal processing~\cite{shuman2013emerging} and cast in terms of  learning filter parameters  of the graph Fourier transform~\cite{bruna2013spectral, henaff2015deep}. Various GNN models have since been proposed~\cite{kipf2016semi, atwood2016diffusion, li2018adaptive, duvenaud2015convolutional,puy2017unifying, dernbach2018quantum, zhang2019quantum}  that   mainly attempt to improve the basic GNN model along two aspects: 1) enhancing the graph convolution operation  by developing novel  graph filters; 
and 2) designing   appropriate graph pooling operations. For instance, \cite{levie2017cayleynets, fey2018splinecnn}  employs complex graph filters  via Cayley and b-splines as a basis for the  filtering operation respectively. For graph pooling operations, pre-computed graph coarsening layers via the graclus multilevel clustering algorithm are employed in~\cite{defferrard2016convolutional}, while a differential pooling operation    is developed in \cite{ying2018hierarchical}. 
The authors in ~\cite{xu2018powerful} propose a sum aggregation pooling operation that is better justified in theory. 
The authors in~\cite{lei2017deriving, gilmer2017neural,dai2016discriminative, garcia2017learning} propose message passing neural networks (MPNNs), which are viewed as equivalent to GCNN models, as the underlying notion of  the graph convolution operation is the same. A similar line of studies have been developed in~\cite{hamilton2017inductive,velivckovic2018deep}   for learning node embedding on large graphs. In contrast, the authors in~\cite{zhang2018end, verma2018graph} propose GNNs for handling graph classification problem. The main limitations of all the aforementioned GNN models lie in that they must be trained from scratch on a new dataset and the embeddings are tuned based on a {\em supervised} (task-specific) objective function. As a result, learned embeddings are task dependent. There is  no mechanism for sharing the embedding model across different datasets. 
Unfortunately  work on designing graph decoder is currently under-explored    and partially falls under graph generation area~\cite{simonovsky2018graphvae, you2018graphrnn, de2018molgan, you2018graph}. But the graph generation  work   do not focus on recovering the exact graph structure but rather generating graph with similar characteristics. 




\textbf{Graph Kernels}: The literature on graph kernels is vast, we only outline a few. Some of the most popular graph kernels are Weisfeiler-Lehman   kernel~\cite{shervashidze2011weisfeiler}, graphlets~\cite{prvzulj2007biological,shervashidze2009efficient}, random walk or shortest path or anonymous walk based kernels~\cite{kashima2003marginalized,borgwardt2005shortest, ivanov2018anonymous}. Several graph kernels   based on more complex kernel functions have also been developed  that can capture sub-structural similarities at multiple levels; these include deep graph kernels~\cite{yanardag2015deep}, graph invariant  kernels~\cite{orsini2015graph} and  multiscale laplacian graph kernel~\cite{kondor2016multiscale}. Instead of directly computing graph kernels,  powerful  graph spectrum based methods have also been developed, for example,
Graphlet spectrum~\cite{kondor2009graphlet}   based on group theory,  and a family of graph spectral distances (FGSD)   based on spectral graph theory.

\noindent \textbf{Basic Setup and  Notations}: Let    be a graph   where  is the vertex set,  the edge set (with no self-loops) and  the       adjacency matrix, with   the graph size. We define the standard graph Laplacian  as , where  is the degree matrix. Let  be the node feature matrix with  as the input dimension and     denotes the hidden dimension.   Further let  be a function of the graph Laplacian i.e.,  ,  where  is the diagonal matrix  of  eigenvalues of  and  the eigenvector matrix. 

Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} depicts the overall architecture of  \textsc{DUGnn}  model.  We describe the core components namely 1) Input Transformer 2) Universal Graph Encoder 3) Multi-Task Graph Decoder, in more detail.

\vspace{-0.5em}
\subsection{Input Transformer}
\vspace{-0.5em}
The dimension of graph input features is task-specific and may differ across different datasets. To make our  universal graph encoder task-independent (or dataset-independent),  we   devise a   specific input layer which transforms  a given input node feature dimension  into a consistent  hidden feature dimension, i.e.,   and feed it to the universal graph encoder. 

It is well known that GNN  models  aggregate  feature information within a hop local neighborhood of a node~\cite{defferrard2016convolutional}. Hence these models heavily  rely on the  initial node features to capture crucial global structural information of a graph. However, in many datasets, the node features are absent (in other words, the inputs are merely the underlying graph structure). In these cases, many models choose , the identity matrix.  Instead, we propose to initialize  as a  Gaussian random matrix (in absence of node features), which is justified by the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Graph Spectral Embedding Approx. with GNN Random   Feature Initialization]\label{theorem:gaussian_initialize} 
	Let  be a function of graph Laplacian and  be a  Gaussian random matrix  initialize as a node feature (or embedding) matrix where . Then     resultant embedding  is equal to a randomly projected  graph spectral embedding in  space i.e,  where  is some random projection in  space.
\end{theorem}

\noindent\textbf{{Remarks}}: The proof relies on the fact that the projection of a Guassian random matrix   onto an eigenspace  of   preserves  the Gaussian properties of ~\cite{paratte2016fast} with probability 1. One of the consequences of Theorem~\ref{theorem:gaussian_initialize} is that  we can approximate different spectral dimension reduction techniques with suitably chosen  function. For instance,  if we choose  as the identity function, the transformation becomes the  Laplacian eigenmaps~\cite{belkin2003laplacian}. Moreover,  remarkably  is nothing but a graph convolution operation and thus provides an approximation of the graph spectral embedding. This provides a theoretical explanation for the competitive performance of a randomly initialized GNN model as previously noted in~\cite{kipf2016semi, velivckovic2018deep}. 

With  	   appropriately initialized  input feature vector ,  our input  transformer performs the following  operation, 
where MLP is a multi-layer perceptron  neural network.
\vspace{-0.8em}
\subsection{Universal Graph  Encoder}
\vspace{-0.7em}
Our universal graph encoder is based on a GNN model but with several key improvements. Let  be a graph filter function. Some early adopted graph filters are  polynomial functions of ~\cite{defferrard2016convolutional}. We simply choose  as  in~\cite{kipf2016semi}. The   layer output of a GNN model  can be written in general as,  where  and . To further improve the model complexity of our graph encoder, we  capture  the  higher order  statistical  moment information of features during the graph convolutional operation, similar to graph capsule networks~\cite{verma2018graph} as follows,   






\vspace{-2em}

\vspace{-2em}

where    is the number of instantiation parameters. Other than boosting the model complexity,  there is standing problem of Laplacian smoothing~\cite{li2018deeper} in GCNN models. To overcome the smoothing problem, we propose to concatenate the output of intermediate   encoding layers and feed it into subsequent layers. This way our graph encoder can learn on multi-scale smooth features of a node and thus can avoid under-smoothing or over-smoothing issues in a GCNN based model. Fortunately, it also enjoy the side benefits of   alleviating   vanishing-gradient problem and strengthen feature propagation in deep networks as shown in  Dense-CNN models~\cite{huang2017densely}. To obtain  the final graph embedding , we perform   sum-pooling on all nodes  and show its representational power below. 

\begin{theorem}[Deep Universal Graph Embedding Representational Power]\label{theorem:rep_power} 
	Deep Universal Graph Embedding model initialized with  node features as  graph spectral embeddings  is   \textbf{atleast} as powerful as the classical Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test. \end{theorem}
\vspace{-0.5em}
\noindent\textbf{{Remarks}}: Theorem~\ref{theorem:rep_power}'s subpart where \textsc{DUGnn} representation power is \emph{same} as  WL graph isomorphism test  directly follows from  Theorem 3 of the paper~\cite{xu2018powerful}. To make \textsc{DUGnn} more powerful  than the classical WL graph isomorphism test (where nodes features are either  identical or equal to respective node degree), one   can initialize \textsc{DUGnn} node features with graph spectral embeddings. As a result,   \textsc{DUGnn} can now differentiate certain regular graphs where the classical  WL graph isomorphism test fails.  The main trick here is to initialize node features such they  depend on the full graph structure rather than the local structure.  Coincidently, we have Theorem~\ref{theorem:gaussian_initialize} to approximate graph spectral embedding in our \textsc{DUGnn} model and that too in fast manner. Although in all fairness, the same trick can also make   WL more powerful. 




Next, we provide the generalization guarantee of  \textsc{DUGnn} model and further discuss  the role of transfer learning in   reducing the generalization gap.
\begin{theorem}[Deep Universal Graph Embedding Model Generalization Guarantee]\label{thm:gcnn_gen_bound} \textit{Let  be a  single layer Universal Graph Encoder        equipped with the graph convolution filter   and trained on a dataset    using  the SGD algorithm for  iterations. Let the loss \& activation functions be Lipschitz-continuous and smooth. Then the  following expected generalization guarantee   holds with probability at least   having ,}
\vspace{-0.5em} 	
	 
	\vspace{-0.5em}
	
	where    is the expected risk taken over   the randomness due to SGD,    is the empirical risk,  is the number of training graph samples,  is the maximum graph-size,  is the largest eigenvalue of graph filter  and   is a upper bound on the loss function.
\end{theorem} 
\vspace{-0.5em}
\noindent\textbf{{Remarks}}: Theorem~\ref{thm:gcnn_gen_bound} relies on showing the fact that Universal Graph Encoders are uniformly stable~\cite{bousquet2002stability} and  has several implications. First, normalized graph filters   are   theoretically more stable (besides numerically) since   and parameter  controls the classic bias-variance tradeoff.  Also the theorem   does not bear any restrictions on type of graph datasets employed for training and establishes that transfer learning remains beneficial between different datasets for graph classification task. Intuitively GNN parameters are learned based  on   the local (hop) graph-structure and having more samples will always help   towards generalizing better on unseen data and    reduces the generalization error at a rate .

\vspace{-0.8em}
\subsection{Multi-Task Graph Decoder}
\vspace{-0.7em}
Multi-task learning     have shown to yield superior results in natural language processing~\cite{mccann2018natural, devlin2018bert}. We want to equip our  \textsc{DUGnn}  model with built-in capabilities of multi-task learning. For this, we employ multiple prediction metrics in our graph decoder to enable it to learn more generalized graph embedding useful for different learning tasks. Note that supervised task specific  loss i.e.,  cross-entropy loss   is not considered as the part of our multi-task decoder (see Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}).

\noindent \textbf{Graph Adjacency Matrix Reconstruction Loss}: The major technical challenge in devising a general purpose graph decoder is reconstructing the original graph structure {\em directly from its graph embedding} vector . 
We consider minimizing adjacency reconstruction loss   as the first task of our graph decoder. Following adjacency loss   is incurred during mini-batch process, 
where  is the encoder output,  is binary cross entropy loss corresponding to presence or absence of each edge and  is loss weight.  There are two shortcomings of this task. First,    does not take  graph embedding  directly into account and as such   graph embedding may incur significant loss of information after the pooling operation. Second,  with  computing  (in every batch iteration) may become   expensive on datasets with large graph-size. In our experiments,  we were able to compute adjacency  reconstruction loss on all  datasets except D\&D.








\noindent \textbf{Graph Kernel Loss}: We propose a novel solution which leverages rich graph kernels to overcome the shortcomings present in  the  first task. In essence, graph kernels are developed to capture various key sub-structural properties of a graph: for two graphs,  provides a measure of their similarity. 
In our decoder design, we incorporate multiple graph kernels \{\}  to jointly learn and predict the quality of (universal) graph 
embedding  directly by minimizing the following unsupervised  joint graph kernel loss  , 

\vspace{-1.5em}

\vspace{-1.5em}

where  is the mean square error loss,  is a (learned) similarity function between two graph embeddings and   is the associated   kernel weight parameter.  By leveraging precomputed graph kernels, our computation is cheap (in every batch iteration), but also  take the graph embedding   directly into account for the joint learning of our graph encoder-decoder model.  




\noindent \textbf{Adaptive Supervised Graph Kernel Loss}:  For supervised task learning problems, we augment the   loss function   with an adaptive supervised graph kernel loss function. Specifically, we focus on graph kernels that are aligned with the task objective. As shown in Equation (\ref{eq:loss_adpative_kernel}), if class labels of two graphs are the same, then we choose the graph kernel with maximum similarity value and vice-versa. Thus, we are making sure to pick only those sub-structural properties that are relevant to a given specific task. For instance, in MUTAG dataset,  counting the number of cycles is more important than computing the  distribution of random walks (see appendix for more details).

\vspace{-1.5em}





\noindent \textbf{Computational Complexity}: Precomputed graph kernel representation are typically bounded by  time per graph (examples include WL, FGSD kernel) where  is number of nodes in a graph. Further computing graph kernel in each batch iteration requires   time and space  where  is number of graphs in batch size. As a a result, our model time and space complexity is bounded by  in each batch iteration. 





\section{Experiment and Results}\label{sec:exp_results}

We evaluate  \textsc{DUGnn}   thoroughly on a variety of graph classification benchmark datasets.

\noindent \textbf{\textsc{DUGnn} Model Configuration}: In the Input Transformer,  we set the hidden dimension  to . For  the graph datasets without node features, we initialize  using a Gaussian random matrix and  choose  as the normalized symmetric   Laplacian.
For the Universal Graph Encoder, we build  layer deep GNN network with  the internal hidden dimensions chosen from  and pick the  instantiation parameter from .   In the  Multi-Task Decoder,  we employed  three graph kernels loss besides adjacency reconstruction loss  1) WL-Subtree   2) Shortest-Path     3) FGSD,   as they are relatively fast to compute and all decoder losses are added with equal weights.   To keep the network outputs stable, we use   batch normalization between   layers   along with the   weight norm regularization and dropout  techniques to prevent overfitting.
In addition, we employed the ADAM optimizer with varying learning rates as proposed in~\cite{vaswani2017attention} and its parameters are set as: the max epoch  , warmup epoch , initial learning rate , max learning rate   and final learning rate . All models are trained with early stopping criteria based on validation loss.






\noindent \textbf{Datasets and Baselines}:  We employed    bioinformatics and  social network benchmark  datasets to evaluate the \textsc{DUGnn} model on the graph classification  task, namely,   {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont 
	PTC, PROTEINS, NCI1, D\&D, ENZYMES, COLLAB, IMDB-BINARY} and {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont IMDB-MULTI} and further details are present in~\cite{yanardag2015deep}. We compare the \textsc{DUGnn} model performance against  recently proposed   GNNs and    state-of-art Graph Kernels as shown in Table~\ref{table:bio_results}. 

















\noindent \textbf{Experimental Set-up}: We first train \textsc{DUGnn} in an unsupervised fashion on   all mentioned datasets together. Here the universal graph encoder   is shared across all the datasets. Next, we fine tune our  \textsc{DUGnn} for each dataset separately using a  cross-entropy loss () corresponding to the graph labels and the adaptive supervised kernel loss.  We report  -fold cross validation results obtained by closely following the same experimental setup used in previous studies~\cite{ying2018hierarchical, xu2018powerful}.
To make a fair comparison, we either cite  the best cross validation results  previously reported   or run the source code if available according to author's guidelines.  Further   details  are   present in the supplementary. 


\noindent \textbf{Graph Classification Results}: Table~\ref{table:bio_results} shows the classification   results on  considered   datasets based on graph neural network models and graph kernel methods. It is clear that \textsc{DUGnn}  \textbf{consistently outperforms} every state-of-art  GNN model  by a margin of   increase in prediction accuracy on \emph{both bioinformatics  as well as  social-network datasets} (with the highest accuracy achieved  on the {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont PTC}).
On relatively  small datasets such as {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont PTC \& ENZYMES},   the increase  in accuracy is around . This empirically confirms our hypothesis that transfer learning in the graph domain  is quite   beneficial,  especially where available graph samples are limited. 

Our \textsc{DUGnn} model  also  significantly outperforms all the state-of-art graph kernel methods. We again  observe a consistent performance gain of     (again with the highest increase on the  {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont PTC} dataset). Interestingly, our \textsc{DUGnn} integrated with graph kernels in the multi-task decoder \emph{outperforms the  WL-subtree  kernel, FGSD and SP  kernel}.





















\section{Ablation Studies and Discussion}\label{sec:ablation_study}

We now take a closer look at the performance of each component of \textsc{Dugnn} model by   performing various ablation studies and show their individual importance and contributions.

We conduct an experiment where the \textsc{Dugnn} model is trained from \emph{scratch without the multi-task decoder}  and evaluate its performance on a   large quantum mechanic  dataset {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont QM8} (containing  compounds). For this purpose, we use the same experimental settings provided in~\cite{wu2018moleculenet} including the same  datasplits  given by the {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont DeepChem}\footnote{https://deepchem.io/} implementation, and compare it against the three state-of-the-art GNNs: 1) MPNN~\cite{gilmer2017neural}, 2) DTNN~\cite{schutt2017quantum} and 3) GCNN\footnote{\label{note1} http://moleculenet.ai/models}. From Table~\ref{table:ugd_perform}, it is clear that our universal graph encoder significantly outperforms these GNNs by a large margin of    in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE), achieving the new state-of-art result on the {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont QM8} dataset.

We conduct an ablation study to determine the importance of utilizing the pretrained  \textsc{Dugnn} model.

Table~\ref{table:transfer_perform} shows that  training without transfer learning reduces accuracy by around  on both datasets. Also, we see a bigger accuracy jump on {\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont PTC}, since its dataset size is smaller, thus benefiting more via transfer learning.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a   powerful {\em univeral graph embedding} neural network  architecture with three carefully designed components that can learn task-independent graph embeddings in a unsupervised fashion. In particular, the universal graph encoder component can be re-utilized across different datasets by leveraging transfer learning, and the  decoder component incorporates various  graph kernels to  capture   rich sub-structural properties to enable multi-task learning. 
Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmark  graph classification datasets, we show that our proposed \textsc{DUGnn}  model can significantly outperform both the existing state-of-art graph neural network models and graph kernel methods. This demonstrates the  
the benefit of combining the power of graph neural networks in the design of a universal graph encoder with that of graph kernels in the design of a multi-task graph decoder.

\section{Appendix}



\section{Proof of Theorem 1}



The proof of Theorem 1 follows immediately from a key result in ~\cite{paratte2016fast}  stated below.

\begin{lemma}~\cite{paratte2016fast} \label{lemma:projection} 
	Let  be an orthonormal matrix and   be a Gaussian random matrix with i.i.d. entries . Then the entries of  are i.i.d. Gaussian random samples with the same pdf  .
\end{lemma}

Let  be a function of graph Laplacian that operates on eigenvalues and defined as follows   where  is the eigenvalue diagonal matrix  and  is the eigenvector matrix which is also an orthonormal matrix. Therefore,  where  is again a  Gaussian random matrix from Lemma~\ref{lemma:projection}. Here  contains the eigenvector columns  scaled by the  eigenvalues. Thus  results in a random projection  (or dimension reduction) of the
scaled eigenvector space of the graph Laplacian into a -dimensional space. 


\section{Proof of Theorem 2}

Theorem 2's subpart where \textsc{DUGnn} representation power is \emph{same} as  Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test  directly follows from  Theorem 3 of the paper~\cite{xu2018powerful}. Note that both the conditions  stated in Theorem 3 are met,  since our node aggregate function and readout function is same as  Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN). To show that \textsc{DUGnn} is \emph{atleast} as powerful than WL, we provide the general condition on -regular graphs to be hold such that their graph representations are different. It is suffice   to show  a single example where WL fails but \textsc{DUGnn} succeeds.

\end{figure}

Consider two -regular non-isomorphic graphs of size  and let  represents the neighbor indices of  node including itself.  Since node features initialized are identical (or equal to node degree) in classic WL  i.e,  for each node , after local aggregation operation, the new node features is given by  for  each node in  where  is a multi-set function and  is a injective function. Similarly for  each node representation is given by  after first iteration which is same as . As a result, the graph representation of  and  are same since sum-pool operation yields the same value i.e.,  in both cases. 

Consider \textsc{DUGnn}  initialized  with graph spectral embeddings  as node features. Let  and  be the spectral embeddings of nodes in and . Then, updated representation  of    node is given by   where  is the universal MLP function.  Let  MLP  function learns an identity function. Then the sum-pool representation of  is given by . Similarly, for  the final representation is  .  As a result, for all non-isomorphic -regular graph pairs whose  row-wise sum of eigenvector matrix respectively are not equal -- can be distinguished by \textsc{DUGnn} -- but not possible in the case of   classic WL.  It is easy to verify numerically that the row-wise sum of eigenvector matrices  of graphs   shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reg_graphs}  are not equal which implies   and hence their graph representations  are different.

\section{Proof of Theorem 3}

Theorem 3 is based on main result of the paper~\cite{verma2019stability} and the extension to graph classification as well as graph capsule networks. We  show that the single layer graph capsule networks are also uniformly stable~\cite{bousquet2002stability} for solving  graph  classification problem. Like in ~\cite{verma2019stability}, we assume that the activation and loss functions are Lipschitz continuous and smooth. For convenience, we borrow the same notions used in~\cite{verma2019stability}   and  similarly divide the proofs in two parts. In first part, we separate out the  terms due to  weight parameters and graph convolution operation in order to bound their difference   independently. In second part, we bound the expected difference (due to   to randomness of SGD algorithm) in weight parameters  under single data perturbation. 

Following is a single layer Universal Graph Encoder  GNN function    based on statistical moments with sum as read-out function in graph classification task where  is number of nodes in a graph,  is the  node feature value and  is the capsule learning parameter. For simplicity, we show our results for the case of   but the proof remains applicable for general  .

The first order derivative with respect to parameter is given as,


where  is number of instantiation parameters.



\noindent \textbf{Proof Part I}:   Let  be expectation due to SGD randomness and let  and   represent the     filter weights learned on training set  and  that differs in precisely single data point. Also,   . 




where  
 is defined as .
The term  will later be bounded in terms of the largest absolute eigenvalue of the graph convolution filter .  

\noindent \textbf{Proof Part II}:   We move on the second part of the proof where we bound the different in weights learned due to single data perturbation in Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_terms} using Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_term1} and Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_term2}. 


\begin{lemma}[\textbf{Universal Graph Encoder    Same Sample Loss Stability Bound}]\label{lemma:sgd_term1}  \textit{The   loss-derivative bound difference   of (single-layer) Universal Graph Encoder    trained with SGD algorithm for  iterations on two training datasets  and  respectively, with respect to the same sample     is given by,}
	
\end{lemma}
\noindent \textbf{Proof}:  Using Equation~\ref{eq:gcnn_derivative} here, we get,	



This completes the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_term1}. \\

\begin{lemma}[\textbf{Universal Graph Encoder    Different Sample Loss Stability Bound}]\label{lemma:sgd_term2}
	\textit{The   loss-derivative bound difference   of (single-layer) Universal Graph Encoder     trained with SGD algorithm for  iterations on two training datasets  and  respectively,  with respect to  the  different samples     is given by,}
	
\end{lemma}
\noindent \textbf{Proof}: 



This completes the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_term2}. \\


\begin{lemma}[\textbf{Universal Graph Encoder    SGD Stability Bound}]\label{lemma:sgd_terms} \textit{ Let the loss \& activation functions be  Lipschitz-continuous and smooth. Let  and  denote the graph filter parameters of (single-layer)  Universal Graph Encode	 trained using SGD for  iterations on two training datasets   and , respectively. Then the expected difference in   the filter  parameters  is bounded by,}
	
\end{lemma}
\noindent \textbf{Proof}: Following the bounding analysis presented in~\cite{verma2019stability} for expected weight difference due to SGD, we have,


 \\


Plugging the bounds in	Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_term1} and Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_term2} into Equation~(\ref{eq:sgd_terms}),  we have,


Lastly,   solving the  first order recursion yields, 

This completes the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_terms}. \\

\noindent \textbf{Bound on : }   Let    and  be the submatrix of   whose row and column indices are from the set .  We use  to denote the  moment graph signal  (node features) on the ego-graph .  Without loss of generality, we will assume that node  is represented by index  in   . Thus, we can compute , a scalar value. Here  represents the value of a vector at index 0, i.e., corresponding to  node . Then the following holds (assuming the graph signals are normalized, i.e., ),

where the third inequality follows from the fact that  for  and since . As a result the norm inequality  holds. 


Finally, plugging  and Lemma~\ref{lemma:sgd_terms} into Equation~(\ref{eq:proof_part1}) yields the following remaining result,



This completes the full proof of Theorem 3.

	\caption{Some MUTAG graph data samples.}\label{fig:projection-results}
	
\end{figure}

We qualitatively demonstrate the    significance of employing the adaptive supervised graph kernel loss on MUTAG dataset. For this purpose, we take a deeper dive into the results to find out which sub-structures are more important for prediction.  Figures~\ref{fig:l1_sample} and \ref{fig:l2_sample} depict some representative  graph structures for class labels  and    on the MUTAG dataset. It turns out that the graph samples with label  have mostly three or more cycles, while the graph samples with  label  tend to contain only one cycle. On the other hand, the graph samples with two cycles can belong to either class. By  simply  creating a learning rule that data samples containing  or more cycles belong to label , we can get a prediction  accuracy around . This simple rule alone beats the random-walk graph kernel based method, which achieves a prediction accuracy of ~\cite{shervashidze2011weisfeiler}. By employing an adaptive supervised graph kernel, the model can thus learn  embeddings which are biased more towards a graph kernel that better captures the count of number of cycles in graphs, and discount the graph kernels which attempt to match the random walk distributions which do not help with increasing the prediction accuracy. 



\section{Experiment Baselines Settings }

For the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel, we vary the iteration pararmeter . For the Random-Walk (RW) kernel, the decay factor is chosen from . For the graphlet kernel (GK), we choose the graphlet  size .  For the deep graph kernels (DGKs),  the  window size and dimension are taken from the set  and report the best classification accuracy obtained among i) deep graphlet kernel, ii) deep shortest path kernel and iii) deep Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel. For the Multiscale Laplacian Graph (MLG) kernel, we vary the  and  parameters of the algorithm from , radius size from , and level number from . For  the diffusion-convolutional neural networks (DCNN), we choose the number of hops from  and employ the AdaGrad algorithm (gradient descent) with the following parameters: the learning rate , batch size  and number of  epochs . We use the node degree   as the labels  in the cases where node labels are unavailable.  For the rest, best reported results are borrowed from their respective papers since the experimental  setup is same and fair comparison can be made.

We observe that employing the adaptive supervised graph kernel loss yields a smoother decay in the validation loss and produces more stable results. However  as evident from Table~\ref{table:adpative_perform}, it only increases the performance  on PTC by ,  and  reducess the performance on ENZYMES by around . As a result, we advice   treating the adaptive supervised kernel loss as a hyper-parameter.
