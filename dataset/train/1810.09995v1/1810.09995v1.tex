\begin{abstract}
Most previous work on neural text generation from graph-structured 
data relies on standard sequence-to-sequence methods. These approaches
linearise the input graph to be fed to a recurrent neural network.
In this paper, we propose an alternative encoder based on graph 
convolutional networks that directly exploits the input structure.
We report results on two graph-to-sequence datasets that empirically 
show the benefits of explicitly encoding the input graph structure.\footnote{Code and data available at \url{github.com/diegma/graph-2-text}.}

\section{Introduction}

Data-to-text generators produce a target natural language text 
from a source data representation. Recent neural generation approaches 
\cite{mei2015talk,lebret-grangier-auli:2016:EMNLP2016,wiseman-shieber-rush:2017:EMNLP2017,gardent-EtAl:2017:INLG2017,ferreira2017linguistic,konstas2017neural} 
build on encoder-decoder architectures proposed for machine translation
\cite{sutskever2014sequence,bahdanau2015neural}.


The source data, differently from the machine translation task, 
is a structured representation of the content to be conveyed.
Generally, it describes attributes and events about entities and relations among them.
In this work we focus on two generation scenarios where the source
data is graph structured.
One is the generation of multi-sentence descriptions
of Knowledge Base (KB) entities from RDF graphs
\cite{perezbeltrachini-sayed-gardent:2016:COLING,gardent-EtAl:2017:Long,gardent-EtAl:2017:INLG2017},
namely the WebNLG task.\footnote{Resource Description Framework \url{https://www.w3.org/RDF/}}
The number of KB relations modelled in this scenario is potentially large and generation involves 
solving various subtasks (e.g. lexicalisation and 
aggregation). Figure (\ref{fig:rdfgraph_srgraph}a) shows and example 
of source RDF graph and target natural language description.
The other is the linguistic realisation of the meaning expressed 
by a source dependency graph \cite{belz2011first}, namely the SR11Deep generation task. 
In this task, the semantic relations are linguistically motivated and their number 
is smaller.
Figure (\ref{fig:rdfgraph_srgraph}b) illustrates a source dependency graph 
and the corresponding target text.


Most previous work casts the graph structured data to text generation 
task as a sequence-to-sequence problem \cite{gardent-EtAl:2017:INLG2017,ferreira2017linguistic,konstas2017neural}.
They rely on recurrent data encoders with memory and gating
mechanisms (LSTM; \cite{lstm1997}). 
Models based on these sequential encoders have shown 
good results although they do not directly exploit
the input structure but rather rely on a separate linearisation step. 
In this work, we compare with a model that explicitly encodes 
structure and is trained end-to-end.
Concretely, we use a Graph Convolutional Network 
(GCN; \cite{kipf2016semi,marcheggiani2017encoding}) 
as our encoder.

GCNs are a flexible architecture that allows explicit encoding 
of graph data into neural networks. Given their simplicity and 
expressiveness they have been used to encode dependency syntax 
and predicate-argument structures in neural machine translation 
\cite{bastings2017graph,marcheggiani2018exploiting}.
In contrast to previous work, we do not exploit the sequential 
information of the input (i.e., with an LSTM), but we solely rely 
on a GCN for encoding the source graph structure.\footnote{Concurrently with this work, \newcite{P18-1026} also encoded input structures without relying on sequential encoders.}

The main contribution of this work is showing that explicitly encoding structured data with GCNs is more effective than encoding a linearized version of the structure with LSTMs.
We evaluate the GCN-based generator on two 
graph-to-sequence tasks, with different level of source content specification.
In both cases, the results we obtain show that GCNs encoders outperforms standard 
LSTM encoders. 



\section{Graph Convolutional-based Generator}
\label{sec:d2tmodel}


Formally, we address the task of text generation from 
graph-structured data considering as input a directed labeled 
graph~$X=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ where $\mathcal{V}$ is a set 
of nodes and $\mathcal{E}$ is a set of edges between nodes 
in $\mathcal{V}$. The specific semantics of $X$ depends on the task at hand. 
The output $Y$ is a natural language text verbalising the content expressed by $X$.
Our generation model follows the standard attention-based encoder-decoder 
architecture \cite{bahdanau2015neural,luong2015effective} and predicts $Y$
conditioned on $X$ as $ P(Y|X) = \prod_{t=1}^{|Y|} P(y_t|y_{1:t-1}, X)$.


\paragraph{Graph Convolutional Encoder}
In order to explicitly encode structural information we adopt graph convolutional networks (GCNs).
GCNs are a variant of graph neural networks \cite{scarselli2009graph} that has been recently proposed by \newcite{kipf2016semi}.
The goal of GCNs is to calculate the representation of each node in a graph considering the graph structure.
In this paper we adopt the parametrization proposed by \newcite{marcheggiani2017encoding} where edge labels and directions are explicitly modeled.
Formally, given a directed graph $X = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is a set of nodes, and $\mathcal{E}$ is a set of edges. 
We represent each node $v \in \mathcal{V}$ with a feature vector $\mathbf{x}_v \in \mathbb{R}^d$.
The GCN calculates the representation of each node $\mathbf{h}'_v$ in a graph using the following update rule:
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{align*}\label{eq:gcn}
\mathbf{h}'_v\!\!=&\rho\Big(\!\!\!\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \!\!\! g_{u, v} \big(W_{dir(u, v)} \, \mathbf{h}_u + \mathbf{b}_{lab(u, v)}\big)\Big),
\end{align*}
\noindent
where $\mathcal{N}(v)$ is the set of neighbours of $v$, $W_{dir(u, v)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ is a direction-specific parameter matrix. 
As \newcite{marcheggiani2017encoding,bastings2017graph} we assume there are three possible directions ($dir(u, v) \in \{in, out, loop\}$): self-loop edges ensure that the initial representation of node $\mathbf{h}_v$ affects the new representation $\mathbf{h}'_v$. 
The vector $\mathbf{b}_{lab(u, v)} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is an embedding of the label of the edge $(u,v)$ 
. $\rho$ is a non-linearity (ReLU).
$g_{u, v}$ are learned scalar gates which weight the importance of each edge.
Although the main aim of gates is to down weight erroneous edges in predicted graphs, they also add flexibility when several GCN layers are stacked.
As with standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs, \cite{lecun-01a}), GCN layers can be stacked to consider non-immediate neighbours.\footnote{We discovered during preliminary experiments that without scalar gates the model ends up in poor local minima, especially when several GCN layers are used.} 

\paragraph{Skip Connections} Between GCN layers we add skip connections.
Skip connections let the gradient flows more efficiently through stacked hidden layers thus making possible the creation of deeper GCN encoders.
We use two kinds of skip connections: residual connections \cite{he2016deep} and dense connections \cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/HuangLMW17}.
Residual connections consist in summing input and output representations of a GCN layer 
$\mathbf{h}^r_v \!=\! \mathbf{h}'_v \! + \! \mathbf{h}_v$.
Whilst, dense connections consist in the concatenation of the input and output representations $\mathbf{h}^d_v = [\mathbf{h}'_v;\mathbf{h}_v]$.
In this way, each GCN layer is directly fed with the output of every layer before itself.

\vspace*{-0.5ex}
\paragraph{Decoder}
The decoder uses an LSTM and a soft attention mechanism \cite{luong2015effective} over the representation induced by the GCN encoder to generate one word~$y$ at the time.
The prediction of word $y_{t+1}$ is conditioned on the previously predicted words $y_{1:t}$ encoded in the vector $\mathbf{w}_t$ and a context vector $\mathbf{c}_t$
dynamically created attending to the graph representation induced by the GCN encoder as
$ P(y_{t+1}|y_{1:t}, X) = softmax(g(\mathbf{w}_t, \mathbf{c}_t))$,
where $g(\cdot)$ is a neural network with one hidden layer.
The model is trained to optimize negative log likelihood:
${\cal L}_{NLL} =  - \sum_{t=1}^{|Y|} log \, P(y_t|y_{1:t-1}, X)$

\section{Generation Tasks}
\label{sec:d2ttasks}
In this section, we describe the instantiation of the input graph $X$
for the generation tasks we address.


\subsection{WebNLG Task}
The WebNLG task \cite{gardent-EtAl:2017:Long,gardent-EtAl:2017:INLG2017} 
aims at the generation of entity descriptions from a set of RDF triples 
related to an entity of a given category \cite{perezbeltrachini-sayed-gardent:2016:COLING}. 
RDF triples are of the form ({\sffamily subject relation object}), e.g.,
({\sffamily Aenir precededBy Castle}), and form a graph in which edges are 
labelled with relations and vertices with subject and object entities.
For instance, Figure (\ref{fig:rdfgraph_srgraph}a) shows a set of RDF 
triples related to the book \emph{Above the Veil} and its verbalisation.
The generation task involves several micro-planning decisions such as lexicalisation ({\sffamily followedBy}
is verbalised as \nl{sequel to}), aggregation (\nl{sequel to Aenir and Castle}),
referring expressions (subject of the second sentence verbalised as pronoun)
and segmentation (content organised in two sentences).


\paragraph{Reification}
We formulate this task as the generation of a target description $Y$ 
from a source graph $X=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ where $X$ 
is build from a set of RDF triples as follows. 
We reify the relations \cite{baader2003description} from the RDF set of 
triples. That is, we see the relation as a concept in the KB and
introduce a new relation node for each relation of each RDF triple.
The new relation node is connected to the subject and object entities 
by two new binary relations A0 and A1 respectively.
For instance, ({\sffamily precededBy A0 Aenir}) and ({\sffamily precededBy A1 Castle}).
Thus, $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of entities including reified relations
and  $\mathcal{V}$ a set of labelled edges with labels $\{A0, A1\}$.
The reification of relations is useful in two ways. The encoder is able to 
produce a hidden state for each relation in the input; and it permits to model
an arbitrary number of KB relations efficiently.


\subsection{SR11Deep Task}
The surface realisation shared task \cite{belz2011first} 
proposed two generation tasks, namely shallow and deep realisation.
Here we focus on the deep task where the input is a semantic dependency graph that
represents a target sentence using predicate-argument structures
(NomBank; \cite{meyers2004nombank}, PropBank; \cite{palmer2005proposition}).
This task covers a more complex semantic representation of
language meaning; on the other hand, the representation is closer
to surface form. 
Nodes in the graph are lemmas of the target sentence. Only complementizers \nl{that}, commas, and \nl{to}
infinitive nodes are removed. Edges are labelled with NomBank
and PropBank labels.\footnote{There are also some cases where syntactic
 labels appear in the graphs, this is due to the creation process (see \cite{belz2011first})
 and done to connect graphs when there were disconnected parts.}
Each node is also associated with morphological (e.g. num=sg) and
punctuation features (e.g. bracket=r). 

The source graph $X=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ is a semantic 
dependency graph. We extend this representation to model morphological
information, i.e. each node in $\mathcal{V}$ is of the form
(lemma, features). For this task we modify the encoder, Section~\ref{sec:d2tmodel},
to represent each input node as $\mathbf{h}_v= [\mathbf{h}_l;\mathbf{h}_f] $,
where each input node is the concatenation of the lemma and the sum of feature
vectors.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:evalsetup}

We tested our models on the WebNLG and SR11Deep datasets.
The WebNLG dataset contains 18102 training and 871 development 
data-text pairs. 
The test dataset is split in two sets, test \textit{Seen} (971 pairs)
and a test set with new unseen categories for KB entities.
As here we are interested only in the modelling aspects of the 
structured input data we focus on our evaluation only on the 
test partition with seen categories.
The dataset covers 373 distinct relations from DBPedia. 
The SR11Deep dataset contains 39279, 1034 and 2398 examples in 
the training, development and test partitions, respectively.
It covers 117 distinct dependency relations.\footnote{
In both datasets we exclude pairs with $>$50 target words.}

\paragraph{Sequential Encoders}
For both WebNLG and SR11Deep tasks we used a standard sequence-to-sequence model \cite{bahdanau2015neural,luong2015effective} with an LSTM encoder as baseline.
Both take as input a linearised version of the source graph.
For the WebNLG baseline, we use the linearisation scripts provided by 
\cite{gardent-EtAl:2017:INLG2017}. 
For the SR11Deep baseline we follow a similar linearisation procedure
as proposed for AMR graphs \cite{konstas2017neural}.
We built a linearisation based on a depth first traversal of the input graph. 
Siblings are traversed in random order (they are anyway shuffled in the given 
dataset). 
We repeat a child node when a node is revisited by a cycle
or has more than one parent.
The baseline model for the WebNLG task uses one layer bidirectional LSTM encoder and one layer LSTM decoder with embeddings and hidden units set to 256 dimensions . 
For the SR11Deep task we used the same architecture with 500-dimensional hidden states and embeddings.
All hyperparameters tuned on the development set.
 

\paragraph{GCN Encoders}
The GCN models consist of a GCN encoder and LSTM decoder.
For the WebNLG task, all encoder and decoder embeddings and hidden units
use 256 dimensions. 
We obtained the best results with an encoder with four GCN layers with residual connections.
For the SR11Deep task, we set the encoder and decoder to use 500-dimensional 
embeddings and hidden units of size 500. In this task, we obtained 
the best development performance by stacking seven GCN layers with dense connections.

We use delexicalisation for the WebNLG dataset and apply 
the procedure provided for the baseline in \cite{gardent-EtAl:2017:INLG2017}. 
For the SR11Deep dataset, we performed entity anonymisation. 
First, we compacted nodes in the tree corresponding to a single 
named entity (see \cite{belz2011first} for details). 
Next, we used a name entity recogniser (Stanford CoreNLP; 
\cite{manning-EtAl:2014:P14-5}) to tag entities in the input 
with type information (e.g. person, location, date). Two 
entities of the same type in a given input will be given
a numerical suffix, e.g. PER\_0 and PER\_1.

\paragraph{A GCN-based Generator}
For the WebNLG task, we extended the GCN-based model to use pre-trained word \textbf{E}mbeddings (GloVe \cite{pennington2014glove})
and \textbf{C}opy mechanism \cite{P17-1099}, we name this variant GCN$_{EC}$. 
To this end, we did not use delexicalisation but rather
represent multi-word subject (object) entities with each word
as a separate node connected with special Named Entity (NE) labelled edges.
For instance, the book entity \emph{Into Battle} is represented as {\sffamily(Into NE Battle)}.
Encoder (decoder) embeddings and hidden dimensions were set to 300.
The model stacks six GCN layers and uses a single layer LSTM decoder.

\paragraph{Evaluation metrics}
As previous works in these tasks,
we evaluated our models using BLEU \cite{papineni2002bleu}, 
METEOR \cite{denkowski2014meteor} and TER \cite{snover2006study}
automatic metrics.
During preliminary experiments we noticed considerable variance 
from different model initialisations; we thus run 3 experiments 
for each model and report average and standard deviation for each metric.

\paragraph{WebNLG task}

In Table \ref{tab:test-results-webnlg} we report results on the WebNLG test data.
In this setting, the model with GCN encoder outperforms a strong baseline that employs the LSTM encoder, with $.009$ BLEU points. 
The GCN model is also more stable than the baseline with a standard deviation of $.004$ vs $.010$.
We also compared the GCN$_{EC}$ model with the neural models submitted to the WebNLG shared task.
The GCN$_{EC}$ model outperforms \textsc{PKUWriter} that uses an ensemble 
of 7 models and a further reinforcement learning step by $.047$ BLEU points; and \textsc{Melbourne} by $.014$ BLEU points.
GCN$_{EC}$ is behind \textsc{ADAPT} which relies on sub-word encoding.

\paragraph{SR11Deep task}
In this more challenging task, the GCN encoder is able to better capture the structure of the input graph than the LSTM encoder, resulting in $.647$ BLEU for the GCN vs. $.377$ BLEU of the LSTM encoder as reported in Table~\ref{tab:test-results-sr11}.
When we add linguistic features to the GCN encoding we get $.666$ BLEU points.
We also compare the neural models with upper bound results on the same dataset by
the pipeline model of \newcite{DBLP:conf/enlg/BohnetMFW11} 
(STUMBA-D) and transition-based joint model of \newcite{DBLP:conf/eacl/ZhangSP17} (TBDIL).
The STUMBA-D and TBDIL model obtains respectively $.794$ and $.805$ BLUE, outperforming the GCN-based model.
It is worth noting that these models rely on separate modules for 
syntax prediction, tree linearisation and morphology generation.
In a multi-lingual setting \cite{mille2017shared},
our model will not need to re-train some modules for different languages, 
but rather it can exploit them for multi-task training.
Moreover, our model could also exploit other supervision signals at training time, 
such as gold POS tags and gold syntactic trees as used in \newcite{DBLP:conf/enlg/BohnetMFW11}.



\subsection{Qualitative Analysis of Generated Text}
We manually inspected the outputs of the LSTM and GCN models.
Table~\ref{tab:sys-output} shows examples of source graphs and generated texts 
(we included more examples in Section \ref{sec:supMaterial}).
Both models suffer from repeated and missing source content (i.e. source 
units are not verbalised in the output text (under-generation)).
However, these phenomena are less evident with GCN-based models. 
We also observed that the LSTM output sometimes presents hallucination 
(over-generation) cases.
Our intuition is that the strong relational inductive bias of GCNs \cite{battaglia2018relational} helps the GCN encoder to produce a more informative representation of the input; while the LSTM-based encoder has to learn to produce useful representations by going through multiple different sequences over the source data.


\subsection{Ablation Study}
In Table \ref{tab:dev-results-webnlg} (BLEU) we report an ablation study on the impact of the number of layers and the type of skip connections on the WebNLG dataset.
The first thing we notice is the importance of skip connections between GCN layers.
Residual and dense connections lead to similar results.
Dense connections (Table \ref{tab:dev-results-webnlg} (SIZE)) produce models bigger, but slightly less accurate, than residual connections.
The best GCN model has slightly more parameters than the baseline model (4.9M vs.4.3M).

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conslusion}
\vspace{-0.5em}
We compared LSTM sequential encoders with a structured 
data encoder based on GCNs on the task of structured data 
to text generation.
On two different tasks, WebNLG and SR11Deep, we
show that explicitly encoding structural information 
with GCNs is beneficial with respect to sequential encoding. 
In future work, we plan to apply the approach to other
input graph representations like Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR; \cite{banarescu2013abstract})
and scoped semantic representations \cite{Noord2018LREC}.

\section{Supplemental Material}
\label{sec:supMaterial}

\subsection{Training details}
We implemented all our models using OpenNMT-py \cite{opennmt}.
For all experiments we used a batch size of 64 and Adam \cite{kingma2015adam} as the optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001.
For GCN models and baselines we used a one-layer LSTM decoder, we used dropout \cite{SrivastavaHKSS14} in  both encoder and decoder with a rate of 0.3. 
We adopt early stopping on the development set using BLEU scores and we trained for a maximum of 30 epochs.
\subsection{More example outputs}
Table \ref{tab:sys-output-additional} shows additional examples
of generated texts for source WebNLG and SR11Deep graphs.
