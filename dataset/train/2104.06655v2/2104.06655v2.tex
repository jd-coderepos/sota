Deep reinforcement learning methods have shown great performance on many challenging cooperative multi-agent tasks. Two main promising research directions are multi-agent value function decomposition and multi-agent policy gradients. In this paper, we propose a new decomposed multi-agent soft actor-critic (mSAC) method, which effectively combines
the advantages of the aforementioned two methods.
The main modules include decomposed Q network architecture, discrete probabilistic policy and counterfactual advantage function (optinal).
Theoretically, mSAC supports efficient off-policy learning and addresses credit assignment problem partially in both discrete and continuous action spaces. Tested on StarCraft II micromanagement cooperative multiagent benchmark, we empirically investigate the performance of mSAC against its variants and analyze the effects of the different components. Experimental results demonstrate that mSAC significantly outperforms policy-based approach COMA, and achieves competitive results with SOTA value-based approach Qmix on most tasks in terms of asymptotic perfomance metric. In addition, mSAC achieves pretty good results on large action space tasks, such as  and .

\section{Introduction}
Many real-world tasks can be modeled as multi-agent systems. Developing AI system for playing multi-agent games has raised much
attention. 
Recent years, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms \cite{b1} have presented impressive results in many challenging multi-agent systems, such as the coordination of autonomous vehicles \cite{b2}, the challenging StarCraft II game \cite{b3}, etc. Maybe the simplest way to solve multi-agent system problems is, treating everything else as the environment for each individual agent, and learning concurrently based on the global reward. However this will face the issues \cite{b4}: (1) non-stationarity: when an agent is learning, the policies of other agents are also changing simultaneously, which means that the dynamic of environments is non-stationary; (2) scalability:
the joint state and action space grows exponentially as the number of agents increases.
To cope with these issues, 
most recent advanced algorithms adopted the paradigm of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE)\cite{b5}, in which they learn a centralized critic conditioned on joint action and observation history and take decentralized execution by learning different local actor (value functions or policies) for each individual agents. 


Following CTDE paradigm, there are two main popular and promising research lines in MARL, one is the value function decomposition approach, another is multi-agent policy gradients. Value Decomposition Network (VDN) \cite{b6} represented joint Q value  as a sum of individual Q-values  that condition only on individual actions and observations. Each decentralized policy arise simply from its local Q values  (selects actions greedily by ). Afterwards, QMIX \cite{b7} employed a network to estimate joint action-values as a non-linear combination of per-agent values that condition on local observations. The representative work of multi-agent policy gradient method is COMA \cite{b8} method, which explicitly used a counterfactual baseline to address the challenges of multi-agent credit assignment and a critic representation to compute the counterfactual baseline efficiently.

Recent work \cite{b16} points out that multi-agent Q-learning with linear value decomposition implicitly implements a classical multi-agent credit assignment method called counterfactual difference rewards, which draws a connection with COMA. 
However, value function decomposition is hard to apply in off-policy training and potentially suffers from the risk of unbounded divergence.
In single-agent problems, to achieve sample efficiency and robust performance, \cite{b6} proposed the soft actor-critic algorithm, which is an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many challenging continuous control benchmarks. 

To attain both stability and good final performance in CTDE paradigm, how to effectively incorporate soft actor critic paradigm with multi-agent value function decomposition would be important. Following the research line of \cite{b14}, our key insight is, to efficiently compute the expected joint Q values, only when this linear condition --- the joint Q value  is the linear mixture of the individual Q value  satisfy, the following equation holds (Detailed proof can be found in Appendix), 

where the   represents neural networks that consist of agent networks   and the mixing network . Note that, in our method, to make the aforementioned equation holds, the mixing network  is not a complex non-linear way but linear weights that is produced by the hyper-network only conditioned on global state information. 


Motivated by these insights, in this paper, we present a novel multi-agent soft actor-critic (mSAC) method, which is based on the following assumption: the joint Q value  is the linear mixture of the individual Q values . mCSAC contains three main components: decomposed soft Q network architecture, decentralized probabilistic policy, and counterfactual advantage function. This method incorporates the idea of the soft actor-critic and multi-agent value function decomposition effectively.


We empirically investigate the performance of our algorithm mSAC and analyze the influence of these components by ablation studies in StarCraft II micromanagement cooperative multi-agent tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that mSAC significantly outperforms current advanced policy-based algorithms (e.g. COMA) and achieves comparable performance with value-based approaches (e.g. Qmix) on most tasks. In addition, the variant method mSAC achieves pretty good results in large action space tasks, like \text {\em 2c\_vs\_64zg} and  task.


To sum up, here are our contributions: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item We propose the novel mSAC method to effectively incorporate soft actor critic with value function decomposition method and investigate its practical performance on StarCraft II cooperative multi-agent benchmark. 
	\item We conduct extensive performance test of different mSAC variants to show the effect of soft value iteration, counterfactual advantage function, probabilistic policy, respectively.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Soft Actor-Critic}
Before introducing the Soft Actor-Critic method (SAC) \cite{b11}, we first briefly present the deep reinforcement learning (RL) problem definition. RL problem is often formulated as a {\em Markov Decision Process} (MDP), . When the RL agent interacting with the environment, at each step, the agent observes a state , where  is the state space, and chooses an action , according to the policy , where  is the state space, then the agent receives a reward  and the environment transforms to a next state . 


The objective of reinforcement learning is to maximize the discounted expected total reward. However, in a maximum entropy RL framework, the goal is not only  to optimize the cumulative expected rewards, but also maximizes the expected entropy of the policy:

, where  is the discounted factor,  denotes 
the state-action marginal distribution of the trajectory
induced by the policy .
SAC is a popular single-agent off-policy actor-critic method
using the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. It utilizes an actor-critic architecture with separate policy and value networks, an off-policy paradigm that enables reuse of previously collected data, and entropy maximization to enable effective exploration. In contrast to other off-policy algorithms, SAC is quite stable and has been considered as a state-of-the-art baseline for a diverse range of RL problems with continuous actions.


\subsection{Value Function Decomposition}
Value function decomposition (VDN ) \cite{b9} methods learn local Q value functions for each individual agent, and then these local Q values are combined with a learnable mixing neural network to produce
joint Q values. 

In VDN, the mixing function  is a simple algorithmic summation. While in QMIX, it's a non-linear monotonic factorization structure, which can achieve a much richer function class at the the same time satisfy the principle of the Individual-Global Maximization (IGM):  a global  performed on  yields the same result as a set of individual  operations
performed on each local .

\subsection{Multi-Agent Policy Gradients}
The centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE)
paradigm has recently attracted attention for its ability
to address non-stationarity problems 
Learning a centralized
critic with decentralized actors (CCDA) is an efficient approach that exploits the CTDE paradigm.
COMA and MADDPG are two representative examples.

COMA uses a centralised critic to estimate the Q function
and decentralised actors to optimise the agentsâ€™ policies. To address the challenges of multi-agent credit assignment,
it uses a counterfactual baseline that marginalises
out a single agentâ€™s action, while keeping the other agentsâ€™
actions fixed. In addition, COMA also uses a critic representation that allows
the counterfactual baseline to be computed efficiently in
a single forward pass. And it updates stochastic policies using the gradients:

where,   is a counterfactual advantage and  is the
joint action other than agent i.

MADDPG\cite{b10} is an adaptation of actor-critic methods which learns deterministic policies in continuous action spaces, considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multi-agent coordination.





\section{Methods}

In this section, we first introduce the definition and notation of the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) and then introduce the multi-agent policy gradient decomposed architecture. Afterwards we present the three variant method: multi-agent soft actor-critic (mSAC) method, multi-agent counterfactual soft actor-critic (mCSAC) method, multi-agent counterfactual actor-critic (mCAC) method, respectively.
\subsection{Problem Formulation}
The fully cooperative multi-agent tasks can be modelled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) \cite{b12} , 
where  is the global state and 
 is a local observation.
At each time-step, each agent i
receives an observation  drawn according to the observation function 
 and selects an action , forming a joint action , and the environment transitions to the next state  according to the
transition function  and receiving a reward  shared by all agents. Each agent learns a
policy , which is parameterized by  and conditioned on the local observation-action history . The joint policy , with parameters , constitute of the joint Q function:

\subsection{Multi-Agent Decomposed Policy Gradient Architecture}
In this part, 
we first present the common multi-agent decomposed policy gradient architecture for all the algorithm variants we will introduce in the next three subsections.


We use function approximators (neural networks) for both the centralized critic: Q-function and the decentralized actor: policy, and alternate between optimizing both networks with stochastic gradient descent. We will consider a parameterized Q function  and a tractable policy ., where  and  are referred to the parameters of the Q networks and policy networks, respectively.

{\bf Policy Network} Also called decentralized actor. For simplicity,
our decentralized actor (policy) network structure is the same as the agent i's local Q network except that one  operation and a  layer is added after the local Q network. At the beginning of training, if the policy networks have improper initialization parameters which would result in policy distribution becomes too sharp potentially, and thereby constrain the degree of exploration. Empirically, we found this clamp operation relieves this issue and accelerates training. The softmax layer is to convert probabilistic logits to the categorical distribution. 
The policy network parameter is shared among all agents, and different agents are distinguished by utilizing a one-hot identity vector, in order to be consistent with Qmix and fair comparing. 


{\bf Value Network} The centralized critic's network structure is modified from Qmix's Q network structure, and is comprised of agent i's local Q network  and mixing network  in which the weights and biases are produced by the separate hyper-networks. Figure 1 illustrates detailed structure of local Q network and the mixing network. 
For each agent i, there is one local Q network that represents its local Q value function . We represent local Q networks as GRUs \cite{b17} that receive the current individual
observation  and the last action  as input at each time step.
The mixing network is a feed-forward neural network that
takes the agent's local Q network outputs as input and mixes them
linearly and followed by an absolute activation function, producing the values of , as shown in Figure 1. To make the equation (1) holds,
the weights and the biases of the mixing network are restricted
to be linear functions of , and the parameters are produced by the separate
hyper-networks same as in Qmix,
which allows us to effectively calculate the expected Q values.

\end{algorithm} 



Before introducing the counterfactual multi-agent soft actor-critic method, 
we first present multi-agent soft actor-critic method (we refer it as mSAC), which adopts the practical approximation to soft policy iteration as in \cite{b11}.

Similar with \cite{b11}, the critic loss function of the mSAC method in multi-agent setting is,
Based on original soft actor-critic algorithm, our methods also utilize two soft Q-value networks  , for , and take the min values as the target.
In equation (7),
\begin{small}
	
\end{small}
and  is a replay buffer containing previously sampled transitions (states, local observations, actions, rewards, next states, next local observations): 
and   is the target Q network, with parameters  that are obtained as an exponentially moving average of the current Q network weights  , which has been shown to stabilize training.  

Note that, in equation (9),  is sampled from agent i's current policy  rather than sampled from the replay buffer. Compared with Qmix, we adopted the additional policy network that outputs the probabilistic policy (which is a probability mass function for discrete domain), which exactly represents the probabilistic value of each agent selects each discrete action. therefore we can calculate the expectation values exactly.



Recent work theoretically proved that the the soft (or call Boltzmann) policy iteration is guaranteed to improve and can converge to the optimal policy. Derived from the soft policy iteration procedure, the objective for policy update is below: 

 is a hyper-parameter that controls the trade-off between maximizing the entropy of policy and the expected discounted return. 


However,  need to be set as different values  at different stages of training or on different tasks. Because in different states, the degree of exploration needed is different. In some states, good policy have been learned, and the corresponding  value should be reduced to very samll to weaken the degree of exploration, but in other states, it's not sure which action is good and which action is bad, so we need to increse the degree of exploration. The SAC algorithm proposes to reconstruct the original soft policy iterative process as a constrained optimization problem, that is, when optimizing the policy to maximize cumulative discount returns, the algorithm should keep the average entropy of policy a fixed value (usually ) and the action entropy in different states can be variable.  Specifically,  is automatically updated by optimizing the following loss \cite{b11}:


The details of the mSAC algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 1.


\subsection{multi-agent Counterfactual Soft Actor-Critic (mCSAC)}
One of the most important problems in multi-agent reinforcement learning is credit assignment. For partially solving this issue, we adopted the insight in COMA that is using the counterfactual advantage function when we optimize the individual policy in the multi-agent decomposed policy gradient paradigms. The loss function of policy in multi-agent  counterfactual soft actor-critic (mCSAC) method is as following:

where,
\begin{small}
	
\end{small}


Note that on the right side of the above equation, ,  refers to the joint actions at time , and  refers to the local action of the agent , and  refers to the (partial) joint actions of the agents other than the agent i.  is sampled from the current policy  of agent i, and  is sampled from the replay buffer  ,
  calculates the counterfactual baseline, which measures the expected action value under the individual policy of the agent  when fix the actions of other agents except agent . If the joint action value of the samples sampled from the replay buffer 
 
is greater than the previous baseline, then we update the policy network parameters of the agent  to increase the action probability of , and vice versa.





\subsection{multi-agent Counterfactual Actor-Critic (mCAC)}
In order to probe the effect of the soft policy iteration paradigm on multi-agent policy optimization, in this section we introduce another variant of the mSAC method: the multi-agent counterfactual actor critic (mCAC) method. 
which can be obatained after deletes the entropy augment item corresponding to  from all loss functions of the mCSAC method. Because it does not satisfy the condition of soft policy iteration paradigm, mCAC becomes an on-policy algorithm. The capacity of the replay buffer used to update the policy and the value network is set to a small value.

The behavior strategy used to collect trajectory experience is not based on the categorical distribution that outputed by the policy network, but a strategy similar to -greedy exploration.
The specific implementation of mCAC is similar to the mSAC algorithm. 
Action probabilities are produced from the final layer, z, via a bounded softmax distribution that lower-bounds the probability of any given action by :
. We anneal  linearly
from 0.5 to 0.02 across 20000 training episodes.







\section{Experiments}
In this section, we present our experimental results and some analysis.  First, we describe the decentralised cooperated StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark to which we apply our proposed method mSAC and the variant methods we consider. Then we present the performance comparison between mSAC, the ablation variant algorithms mCSAC, mCAC and the representative value decomposed algorithm---Qmix and policy gradient algorithm---COMA   
in aforementioned discrete action environments. 
We used the Qmix implementation from this open-source code \footnote{\url{https://github.com/starry-sky6688/StarCraft}} with the same hyper-parameters as \cite{b7}. 
To be consistent with previous work, our implementation \footnote{\url{https://github.com/puyuan1996/MARL}} 
almost use the same network architecture and hyper-parameters across all the tasks.
 More experimental details can be found in the Appendix.


{\bf Experimental Setup}
We focus on the StarCraft II decentralized micromanagement tasks \cite{b13} \footnote{We use StarCraft 2 Version SC2.4.10 in our experiments.}, in which each of the agents controls an individual army unit and each agent receives a global shared reward. We use StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment [15] as our APIs, which has become
a common-used benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art MARL approaches such as COMA, QMIX and other baseline algorithms. In this paper, our algorithm learns multiple agents (or called policies) to control allied units to beat the
enemy, while the enemy units are controlled by a built-in handcrafted AI, which make use of the handcrafted heuristics. 
Two representative StarCraftII micromanagement
scenarios ( and ) are shown in Figure 2.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/map1.png} 
\caption{Visualizations of the two representative StarCraftII micromanagement scenarios ( and ).}
	\label{wolf2}
\end{figure}













For comparing each methodâ€™s performance justly as much as possible, our Qmix implementation also use target Q networks that are obtained as an exponentially moving average of the Q function weights, which was different from the hard update manner in the original paper \cite{b7}. 
In addition, we adopt the same evaluation procedure as in  \cite{b7}. For each run of a method, we pause training every 100 episodes and run 20 independent episodes where each agent performing greedy decentralised action selection (for Qmix chosen the action with the largest local Q values, for other methods chosen the action with the largest probability value). The percentage of these episodes in which the method defeats all enemy units within the (different) time limit is referred as the test win rate.

The magnitude of x-axis is 100 episodes, and for different maps, there are different episode length limits according to the difficulty level of different tasks. The shaded region indicates the one  quarter of standard deviation.

{\bf Algorithm Details of Variant Methods}
The policy network of all agents includes a recurrent layer composed of GRUs with 64-dimensional hidden states, and a fully connected MLP layer before and after this. After the team is defeated or the time step limit is reached, one episode ends.
 The mixed network part of the value function consists of a single hidden layer of 64 units, and the ELU nonlinear activation function is not used. Its weights and biases are generated by an additional hyper-network composed of a single hidden layer of 64 units without the ReLU nonlinear activation function.
 
 Similar to Qmix, the mSAC algorithm training is also carried out in mini-batch mode, the batch size is 32, the target smoothing coefficient used to update the two target Q networks is 0.005, and the discount coefficient is set to 0.95.
 Due to parameter sharing, all agents will be processed in parallel, and the information of each agent at each time step of each episode occupies one entry of the mini-batch. Once a new episode of trajectory is added to the replay buffer, the algorithm will update the network parameters of the actor and critic.
 Specifically, after collecting a episode of trajectory, 32 episodes were sampled from the replay buffer as a mini-batch to train the actor and the critic, fully expand the recurrent network part of the actor and the critic at all time steps and backpropagate the gradients, then apply the summarized gradient update to the neural network. For clarity, the hyperparameter settings of the mSAC algorithm are summarized in Table 1.

  The learning performance of the mSAC method and its variant methods mCSAC and mCAC on the StarCraft II micro-operation task were tested separately to study the impact of off-policy update, soft Q value, probability distribution policy, counterfactual advantage function and other modules on the multi-agent policy gradient algorithm.
 In all maps, all algorithms used reward standardization techniques for stability purposes,

In this part, we compared the performance of our method mSAC, its variant methods mCSAC, mCAC, and advanced Qmix and COMA methods in the different maps, including
maps with homogeneous agents (, ), and maps with heterogeneous agents (, , ), maps that agent contains a large action space (, , , ).
 The performance test win rate learning curves are shown in Figure 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
Through the experimental results, it can be found that the method mSAC proposed in this chapter is similar to  policy-based method COMA on the map of homogeneous agents, and is significantly better than COMA on other maps. In the maps , , , , compared with the current value-based method Qmix, it has similar asymptotic performance. In the map with a large action space for the agent (, , ), its performance is significantly better than Qmix. In some relatively difficult tasks, such as , the performance of all policy-based methods is worse than Qmix but not much.
After carefully analyzing the experimental results, the following observations and conclusions can be drawn:




{\bf 1. Soft policy iteration paradigm is also effective in multi-agent scenarios. }
From the comparison of the results of all maps we found that mCAC behaves worse than the other methods both in stability and asymptotic performance, which indicates that soft policy iteration paradigm is usually beneficial to the robust policy improvement in multi-agent policy gradient setting. We conjecture that this is because simultaneously maximizing expected return and entropy can make the agent explore more widely and efficiently, and can capture multiple modes of near-optimal behaviours. 


{\bf 2. It is important to jointly optimize the entire policy distribution On tasks where the agent has a relatively large action space. }
For example, in the map , the Colossi unit has a large action space . In the Qmix method, all agents are executed in a decentralized manner. Each agent greedily selects actions based on its local action value function. In a certain state, there is only one action that maximizes the local action value, and the others actions are given the same selection probability . At a certain time, in map , the probability of ally unit attacking a specific enemy among all the 64 enemy units is very high, while the The probability of attacking the other 63 units is the same .
While in the mSAC method, each agent executes actions according to its own strategy, that is, the learned categorical distribution, and can choose different areas of the action space in a planned way.
By jointly optimizing the entire probability distribution to maximize the sum of expected returns and strategy entropy, intuitively speaking, this is more reasonable and effective than Qmix's -greedy paradigm exploration on tasks with large action spaces.

{\bf 3. Counterfactual advantage functions are not always effective, and are more important in relatively complex tasks. }
For easy environments, like map , the performance of mCSAC and mSAC is similar, but in harder environment, like map  , the performance gap of mCSAC and mSAC is larger, which indicates that attribution of global reward is critical for solving this harder task, the counterfactual advantage function partially addresses the issue, could gradually learn a reasonable credit assignment during training in some tasks but is not always effective. Moreover, we carefully analyzed the performance of each seed and found that after training of 80000 episodes, in some seeds the test win rate can perform up to 90\%, and some seeds are zero. We speculate that this may because it's more difficult to explore good strategies in difficult maps, which indicates that effective exploration would be a important research problem.





\section{Conclusion and Future Works}

In this paper, we presented the new decomposed multi-agent soft actor-critic method (mSAC) that incorporates value function decomposition, soft policy iteration, and counterfactual advantage function (optional), which supports efficient off-policy learning and addresses the issue of credit assignment partially.
mSAC learns the distributional policy for each agent simultaneously which seems like a guided distributional exploration implicitly,
which is especially important in large action space task through the experimental results. 

In addition, we empirically investigate the performance of mSAC and its variant methods
in StarCraft II micromanagement cooperative multi-agent benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that mSAC can achieve relatively stable and efficient multi-agent off-policy learning and outperforms, or is competitive with, current main policy-based algorithms and value-based approaches (e.g. COMA, and Qmix) on most tasks, and achieves very good results in large action space task like \text {\em 2c\_vs\_64zg} and .

However, in this paper, we only study the effect of counterfactual multi-agent soft actor-critic paradigm on the discrete domain. 
Experiments under continuous domain need to be studied. In addition,
The more solid theoretical analysis of the algorithm will be needed, and at the same time, how to explore more efficiently will be a valuable future work.
