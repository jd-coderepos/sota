\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

A graph  is a {\em pairwise compatibility graph (PCG)}  if there exists an edge-weighted tree  and two non-negative real numbers  and  such that each leaf  of  is a node of  and there is an edge  if and only if  where  is the sum of weights of the edges on the unique path from  to  in . 

This graph class arose in the context of the sampling problem on phylogenetic trees  \cite{Kal03}, subject to some biologically-motivated constraints, in order to test the reconstruction algorithms on the smaller subtrees induced by the sample. The constraints on the sample attempt to assure that the behavior of the algorithm will not be biased by the fact it is applied on the sample instead on the whole tree. 

Much attention has been dedicated to PCGs in the literature. However, many problems remain open and we are still far from a complete characterization of the PCG class.
Any progress towards the solution of the latter problem would be interesting not only from a graph theory perspective but also because it could help in the design of better sampling algorithms for phylogenetic trees.

In this note, we start from the knowledge that certain graph classes with a strong structure are known to be in PCG, and we wonder whether some of their superclasses remain in PCG.
Namely, it is well known that interval graphs are in PCG \cite{BH08}; we consider more general intersection graphs, as disk graphs, grid intersection graphs and circular arc graphs, and we prove that these three superclasses of interval graphs are not in PCG.
Permutation and trapezoid graphs, superclasses of circular arc graphs, are trivially not in PCG, too.

Moreover, we consider threshold graphs, an important subclass of interval graphs, that can be defined in terms of weights and thresholds; it is known that threshold graphs are in PCG  \cite{CPS11}; we analyze some of its superclasses that can be defined in terms of weights and thresholds, too, such as threshold tolerance and tolerance graphs; we prove here that threshold tolerance graphs still are in PCG while tolerance (i.e. parallelepiped) graphs are not.

In this way, we heavily delimitate the width of PCGs moving one step ahead toward the full comprehension of this interesting class of graphs.



\section{Superclasses of Interval Graphs}

A graph is an {\em interval} graph if it has an intersection model consisting of intervals on a straight line. 
Interval graphs are in PCG \cite{BH08}, and the witness tree is a  {\em caterpillar},  i.e. a tree in which all the nodes are within distance 1 of a central path, called spine.

In this section we consider some superclasses of interval graphs, defined as intersection graphs, and we prove that all these classes are not included in PCG, as there is at least one graph belonging to them that is not in PCG. 

A {\em disk} graph is the intersection graph of disks in the plane. 
A graph is {\em grid intersection} if it is the intersection graph of horizontal and vertical line segments in the plane.  
A {\em circular arc} graph is the intersection graph of arcs of a circle. 

It is known that graph  depicted in Fig. \ref{fig.graph}.a is not in PCG \cite{DMR13}. 
On the other hand, Figures \ref{fig.graph}.b, \ref{fig.graph}.c and  \ref{fig.graph2}.a show a representation of graph  as a disk graph, as a grid intersection graph  and as a circular arc graph, respectively.
This is enough to ensure the correctness of the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
Disk graphs, grid intersection graphs and circular arc graphs are not in PCG.
\end{theorem}

A graph is {\em rectangle (square) intersection} if it has an intersection model consisting of axis-parallel rectangular (squared) boxes in the plane. 

Rectangle (square) intersection graphs are a superclass of grid intersection graphs, and so it holds:

\begin{Corollary}
Rectangle (square) intersection graphs are not in PCG.
\end{Corollary}

Figure \ref{fig.graph2}.b shows a representation of  as square intersection graph: although not necessary to prove that rectangle (square) intersection graphs are not in PCG, it will be useful for proving Theorem 2.
Moreover, we remark that rectangle intersection graphs are a superclass of Dilworth 2 graphs, that are known to be in PCG \cite{CP13}.

A {\em trapezoid} graph is the intersection graph of trapezoids between two parallel lines.
A {\em permutation} graph is the intersection graph of  straight lines between two parallels. 
The following chain of inclusions holds:

interval graphs  circular arc graphs  permutation graphs  trapezoid graphs

\noindent
leading to the following statement:
\begin{Corollary}
Trapezoid and permutation graphs are not in PCG.
\end{Corollary}
We point out that split permutation graphs, a proper subclass of permutation graphs, is in PCG \cite{CP13}.

A graph is a \emph{tolerance graph} \cite{GMT84} if to every node  can be assigned a closed interval  on the real line and a tolerance  such that  and 
 are adjacent if and only if , where  is the length of the interval . 
Tolerance graphs can be described through another intersection model, as they are equivalent to {\em parallelepiped} graphs, defined as the intersection graphs of {\em special parallelepiped} on two parallel lines.
Let  and  be two parallel lines in 3-dimensional Euclidean space: 
 and ; 
a {\em special parallelepiped} on two parallel lines is either
\begin{itemize}
\item the convex hull of eight points:
; ;
; ;
; ;
; 
for some  with  a parallelogram between L and M; or
\item the line segment between  and  for some .
\end{itemize}

Consider now the squares depicted in Figure \ref{fig.graph2}.b and consider them as the bases of cubes lying in the 3-dimensional semispace with not negative  values. 
The intersection graph of these cubes is , so showing that it is a tolerance graph, and proving the following theorem:

\begin{theorem} 
Tolerance graphs are not in PCG.
\end{theorem}

\section{Superclasses of Threshold Graphs}

A graph  is a \emph{threshold} graph  if there is a real number   and for every node  in  there is a real weight  such that:  is an edge if and only if   \cite{MRT88,MP95}. They are in PCG, as shown in \cite{CPS13}, and the witness tree is a star.

We consider a superclass of threshold graphs that can be also defined in terms of weights and thresholds: threshold tolerance graphs; we put them in relation with the PCG class proving that threshold tolerance graphs are in PCG.

A graph  is a \emph{threshold tolerance} graph if it is possible to associate weights and tolerances with each node of  so that two nodes are adjacent exactly when the sum of their weights exceeds either of their tolerances.
More formally, there are positive real-valued functions, weights  and tolerances  on  such that   if and only if .
In the following we  indicate with  a graph in this class.
Threshold tolerance graphs have been introduced in \cite{MRT86} as a generalization of threshold graphs, that can be obtained by defining the tolerance function as a constant \cite{MRT88}. 

Before proving that threshold tolerance graphs are in PCG, we need to demonstrate a preliminary lemma stating that, when we deal with threshold tolerance graphs, w.l.o.g. we can restrict ourselves to the case when  and  take only positive integer values.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma.int}
A graph  is a threshold tolerance if and only if there exist two functions  such that  is threshold tolerance.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Clearly if  exist then by definition  is a threshold tolerance graph. Suppose now  is a threshold tolerance graph which weight and tolerance functions  and  are both defined from  to . 
Nevertheless, it is not restrictive to assume that  in view of the density of rational numbers among real numbers.
So, we can assume that, for each ,  and .
Let  be the minimum common multiple of all the numbers  and , . 
So we can express  and  as  and 
 where  and  are integer values.

Define now the new functions  and  as  and , .
Clearly, it holds that  while .

In order to prove the claim, it remains to prove that  and  define the same graph defined by  and .
This descends from the fact that  if and only if . \qed
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
\label{th.TTinmLPG}
Threshold tolerance graphs are in PCG.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let  be a threshold tolerance graph. 
Let .
In view of Lemma \ref{lemma.int}, it is not restrictive to assume that , so we split the nodes of   in groups  such that . Observe that for some values of  the set   can be empty.  

We associate to  a caterpillar  as in Figure \ref{fig:tree}. 
The spine of the caterpillar is formed by  nodes, , and each node  is connected to the leaves  corresponding to nodes  in . 
The weights  of the edges of  are defined as follows: 
\begin{ditemize}
\item For each edge of the spine  for .  
\item For each leaf  connected to the spine through node  we assign a weight . 
\end{ditemize}



\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{tree.pdf}
\caption{\footnotesize{The caterpillar used in the proof of Theorem \ref{th.TTinmLPG} to prove that threshold tolerance graphs are in mLPG.}}
\label{fig:tree}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We show that . 
To this purpose consider two nodes  and  in . 
By construction, in  we have that  is connected to  and  to , where  and  are not necessary distinct. 
Clearly, w.l.o.g we can assume , i.e. . 
We have that 


Clearly,  since  is a positive integer, due to Lemma \ref{lemma.int}; moreover  if and only if   and this proves the assertion. \qed
\end{proof}


\section{Conclusions}

In this note, we observe that two important classes of graphs, i.e. interval and threshold graphs, have a strong structure and are known to be in PCG.
We consider some superclasses of these classes, obtained by generalizing their definitions (either intersection graphs or graphs defined in terms of weights and thresholds) and we studied them w.r.t. the class of Pairwise Compatibility Graphs.
In this way, we have moved one step ahead toward the full comprehension of the interesting class of PCGs.
