\maketitle


\begin{abstract} Three types of explicit estimators are proposed here to estimate the loss rates of the links in a network of the tree topology. All of them are derived by the maximum likelihood principle and proved to be either asymptotic unbiased or unbiased. In addition,  a set of formulae are derived to compute the efficiencies and variances of the estimators that also cover some of  the estimators proposed previously. The formulae unveil that the variance of the estimates obtained by a maximum likelihood estimator for the pass rate of the root link of a multicast tree is equal to the variance of the pass rate of the multicast tree divided by the pass rate of the tree connected to the root link. Using the formulae, we are able to evaluate the estimators proposed so far and select an estimator for a data set.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section1}
Network characteristics, such as link-level loss rate, delay distribution, available
bandwidth, etc. are valuable information to network
operations, development and researches. Therefore,
 a considerable attention has been given to network
measurement, in particular to  large networks that cross a number of autonomous systems, where security concerns, commercial interests, and administrative
boundary make direct measurement impossible. To overcome the security and administrative obstacles, network tomography was
proposed in \cite{YV96}, where the author suggests the use of
end-to-end measurement and statistical inference to estimate the characteristics of interest.
Since then,
many works have been carried  out to estimate various characteristics that cover loss tomography \cite{CDHT99, CDMT99, CDMT99a, CN00, XGN06, BDPT02,ADV07, DHPT06, ZG05, GW03}, delay tomography
\cite{LY03,TCN03,PDHT02, SH03, LGN06},
 loss pattern tomography \cite{ADV07}, and so on. Despite the enthusiasm  in loss tomography, there has been little work to study the statistical properties of an estimator with a finite sample size although some asymptotic properties are presented in the literature \cite{CDHT99, DHPT06}.  The  finite sample properties, such as efficiency and variance,  differ from  the asymptotic ones that are critical to the performance evaluation of  an estimator since each of them unveil the quality and effectiveness of an estimator in a specific aspect.  Apart from that, the finite sample properties can be used to select a better estimator, if not the best,  from a group for a data set obtained from a specific circumstance. To fill the gap, we in this paper propose a number of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) that can be solved explicitly for a network of the tree topology and provide  the statistical properties of them. The statistical properties are further extended to cover the MLEs proposed previously. One of the most important discoveries is a set of formulae to compute the efficiency and variance of the estimates obtained by an estimator.

The approach proposed in \cite{YV96} requires us to send probing packets, called probes, from some end-nodes called sources  to the
receivers located on the other side of the network, where the paths
connecting the sources to the receivers cover the links of interest. To make the probes received informative in statistical inference,
 multicast or unicast-based multicast proposed in \cite{HBB00,CN00}  is used to send probes from a source to a number of receivers, via a number of intermediate nodes that replicate the arrived probes and then forward to its descendants. This process continues until either the probes reach the destinations or lost, which makes the observations of any two receivers correlated in some degree and the degrees vary depending on the interconnection between the receivers.  Given the network topology used for sending probes and the observations obtained at receivers, we are able to create a likelihood function to connect the observation  to the process described above. 
 Since the number of correlations created by multicasting are proportional to the number of descendants attached to a node, the likelihood equation obtained for a node having many descendants is a high degree polynomial that requires an iterative procedure, such as  the expectation and maximization (EM) or the Newton-Raphson algorithm, to approximate the solution. Using iterative procedure to solve a polynomial has been widely criticised  for its computational complexity that increases with the number of descendants attached to the link or path to be estimated \cite{CN00}.  There has been a persistent effort in the research community to search for explicit estimators that are comparable in terms of accuracy to the estimators using iterative approach.  To achieve this, we must have the statistical properties of the estimates obtained by an estimator, such as unbiasedness, efficiency, and variance. Unfortunately, there has been little work in a general form for the properties and the asymptotic properties obtained in \cite{CDHT99, DHPT06} has little use in this circumstance.

  To overcome the problems stated above,   we have undertaken a thorough and systematic investigation of the estimators proposed for loss tomography that aims at identifying the statistical principle and strategies that have been used or can be used in the tree topology. A number of findings are obtained in the investigation that show all of the estimators proposed previously  rely on observed correlations to infer the loss/pass rates and most of them use all of the correlations available in estimation, such as the MLE  proposed in \cite{CDHT99}. However, the qualities of the correlations, measured by the fitness between a correlation and the corresponding observation, are very much ignored. Rather than using all of the correlations available in estimation, we propose here to use a small portion of high-quality ones and expect the estimates obtained by such an estimator are comparable to that considering all of the correlations.  The investigation further leads to a number of findings that contribute to loss tomography in four-fold.


\begin{itemize}
\item A large number of explicit estimators are proposed on the basis of composite likelihood \cite{Lindsay88} that are divided into three groups: the block wised estimators (BWE), the reduce scaled  estimators (RSE), and the individual based estimators (IBE).
\item The estimators in BWE and IBE are proved to be unbiased and that in RSE are proved to be  asymptotic unbiased as that proved in   \cite{DHPT06}. A set of formulae are derived for the efficiency and variances of the estimators in RSE and IBE, plus the MLE proposed in \cite{CDHT99}. The formulae show the variance of the estimates obtained by a MLE can be exactly expressed by the pass rate of the path of interest and the pass rate of the subtrees connected to the path.  The formulae also show the weakness of the result obtained in \cite{DHPT06}.
\item  The efficiency of the estimators in IBE are compared with each other on the basis of the Fisher information that  shows an estimator considering  a correlation involving a few observers can be more efficient than that considering more and the estimator proposed in \cite{DHPT06} is the least efficient. A similar conclusion is obtained for the estimators in BWE.
\item  Using the formulae, we able to identify an efficient estimator by examining the end-to-end observation that makes model selection not only possible but also feasible. A number of simulations are conducted to verify this feature that also show the connection between efficiency  and robustness of an estimator.
    \end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section \ref{related work},  we briefly introduce the previous works related to explicit loss rate estimators and point out the weakness of them. In Section \ref{section2}, we introduce the loss model, the notations, and the statistics used in this paper.  Using the model and statistics, we  derive a MLE that considers all available correlations for a network of the tree topology in Section \ref{section3}. We then decompose the MLE into a number of components according to correlations and derive a number of likelihood equations for the components in Section \ref{section 4}. A statistic analysis of the proposed estimators is presented in Section \ref{section5} that details the statistical properties of the proposed estimators, one of them is the formulae to calculate the variances of various estimators. Simulation study is presented in Section \ref{section 6} that compares the performance of five estimators and shows the feasibility of selecting an estimator for a data set.
Section \ref{section7} is devoted to concluding remark.

\section{Related Works}\label{related work}

Multicast Inference of Network Characters (MINC) is the pioneer of using the ideas proposed in \cite{YV96} into practice, where a
Bernoulli model is used to model  the loss behaviors of a path. Using
this model, the authors of \cite{CDHT99} derive an estimator in the form of a polynomial that is one degree less than the number of descendants
connected to the end node of the path of interest \cite{CDHT99, CDMT99,CDMT99a}.  Apart from that, the authors obtain a number of results  from asymptotic theory, such as the large number behaviour of the estimator and the dependency of the estimator variance on topology. Unfortunately, the results only hold if the sample size  grows indefinitely. In addition, if ,  almost all of the estimators proposed previously must have the same results and no one can tell the difference between them.  In order to evaluate the performance of an estimator, experiments and simulation have been widely used but lead to little result since there are too many random factors affecting the results obtained from experiments and simulations.

To overcome the problem stated, simple and explicit estimators, such as that proposed in \cite{DHPT06}, are investigated that aims at reducing the complexity of an estimator and hopefully  finding theoretical support for further development since a simple estimator may be easy to analyse.
Using this strategy, the authors of \cite{DHPT06} propose an explicit estimator that only considers a correlation, i.e. the correlation involving all descendants, and claim the same asymptotic variance for the estimates obtained by the estimator as that obtained by the estimator proposed in \cite{CDHT99} to first
order. The claim is obtained by applying  the central limited theorem (CLT) on one of the results acquired by the asymptotic theory in \cite{CDHT99}, where  the covariance between two descendants attached to the path of interest is obtained by assuming the loss rate of a link is very small and then the delta method is used to compute the asymptotic variance on the covariance matrix obtained by the asymptotic theory. The repeated use of the CLT makes the claim questionable and expensive to use in practice since the result only holds if . Apart from that, some sensitive parameters are cancelled out in the process. It is easy to prove that under the same condition, most of the estimators proposed so far can achieve the same result, if not better,  as that proposed in \cite{DHPT06}.








In contrast to \cite{DHPT06}, \cite{ADV07, Zhu11a} propose an estimator that converts a general tree into a binary one and subsequently makes the likelihood equation into a quadratic equation of   that is solvable analytically.   Experiments show the estimator preforms better than that in \cite{DHPT06} since the estimator uses more information in estimation.  Except experimental results, there is little statistical analysis to demonstrate why it is better than that proposed in \cite{DHPT06} and how to improve from there. Although the author of \cite{Zhu11a} proves the estimator is a MLE, there is a lack of other statistical properties, such as whether the MLE proposed in \cite{Zhu11a} is the same as that proposed in \cite{CDHT99} and if not, how much difference between them.

To be able to evaluate the performance of an estimator, we need to have the statistical properties of the estimator, such as unbiasedness, efficiency, variance, and so on, that differ from the asymptotic ones by showing the quality of an estimator in a finite sample. To distinguish the properties from the asymptotic ones, we call them finite sample properties and there has been a lack of results for the finite sample properties.  This paper aims to fill the gap and provides the properties.

\section{Assumption, Notation and Sufficient Statistics} \label{section2}

 To make the following statistical analysis clear and rigorous, we need to use  a large number of symbols that may overwhelm the readers who are not familiar with loss tomography. To assist them, the symbols  will be gradually introduced through the paper, where the frequently used symbols will be introduced in the following two sections and the others will be brought up  until needed. In addition, the most frequently used symbols and their meanings are presented in Table \ref{Frequently used symbols and description} for quick reference.


\subsection{Assumption}
We assume the probes multicasted from the source to receivers are
independent and network traffic remains statistically stable during the measurement. In addition, the observation obtained at receivers  is considered to be independent identical distributed
(). Further, the losses occurred at a node or on a link are assumed to be   as well.




\subsection{Notation}\label{treenotation}

As stated, a network of the tree topology is considered in this paper and denoted 
by  that multicasts probes from the source to a number of receivers, where   is a set of
nodes and  is a set of directed links that connect the
nodes in . In addition,  is often called node  and  called link  in the following discussion. By default,  node  is the root node of the multicast tree to which the source is attached. Apart from being the root that does not have a parent, node  is different from  others by having a single descendant, , that is connected by .  Among the nodes in , there are a number of them called leaf nodes that do not have any descendant but a receiver is attached to a leaf node. Because of this, we do not distinguish between a leaf node and a receiver and we use  to denote them. Since there are  links to connect   nodes in , the links and nodes are organised in such a way that if  is used to denote
the parent of node ,   is the link connecting  to
.  Figure \ref{tree example} is an example of a multicast binary tree that is named and connected according to the rules.

A multicast tree, as a tree, can be decomposed into a number of
 multicast subtrees at node , where  denotes the multicast subtree that has  as its root,  as its root link,  and  as the receivers attached to .  In addition, we use   to denote the descendants attached to node  that is a nonempty set if . If  is a set,  is used to denote the number of elements in . Thus,  denotes the number of descendants in  . Using the symbols on Figure \ref{tree example}, we have ,  ,  ,  and .

 If  probes are sent from  to  in an experiment,
each of them gives rise of an independent realisation
of the passing (loss) process . Let  donate the  process, where  if probe 
reaches ; otherwise . The sample
 is  the observation obtained in an experiment that can be divided into a number of sections according to , where  denotes the part of  obtained by . In addition, each of the sections can be further divided into subsections  that is the part of observation obtained by . Obviously, .
If we use  to denote the observation of receiver  for probe , we have  if probe  is observed by receiver ; otherwise, .

 Although loss tomography aims at estimate the loss rate of a link,  the pass rate of the path connecting  to  is often used as the parameter  to be estimated. Let  be the pass rate of the path connecting  to  that is defined as the percentage of the number of probes arrived at node  among the number of probes sent by the source.  Given , we are able to compute the pass rates of all links in  since there is a bijection from the pass rates of the paths to the pass rates of the links in a network of the tree topology.  If  denotes the pass rate of link  we have
 
Given , we are able to compute the loss rate of link  that is equal to .


\subsection{Statistics}

\label{mlesection}

To estimate   from , we need a likelihood function to connect the {\it i.i.d.} model defined previously to . To support the initiative of using a part of the available correlations to estimate , a function, , defined as follows is used to return the statistic for the likelihood function:
 
Obviously.
 \noindent   is the number of probes, confirmed by the observation of , reaching node . If  is used to denote the number of probes reaching node , we have , where  and  are of statistics that can be used to estimate .

 To write a likelihood function of  with ,  and  are introduced to denote the pass rate of the subtrees rooted at node  and the pass rate of the special multicast tree that connects  to node  and then to . Clearly  and  that is the empirical value of . Note that  is the empirical pass rate of the path from the root to node .
Given the assumptions and definitions,  the likelihood function of  for observation  is written as follows:

We can then prove   is a sufficient statistic with respect to ({\it wrt.}) the passing process of  for the observation obtained by . Rather than using the well known factorisation theorem in the proof, we directly use the mathematic definition of a sufficient statistic (See definition 7.18 in \cite{RM96}) to achieve this. The definition {\it wrt.} the statistical model defined for the passing process is presented as a theorem here:

sufficient for  in respect of the observation of .
\end{theorem}

\begin{IEEEproof}
According to the definition of sufficiency, we need to prove
 is independent of .

Given (\ref{likelihood function}), the passing process with observation of  is a random process that yields the binomial distribution as follows

Then, we have

which is independent of . Then,  is a sufficient statistic.

Apart from the sufficiency,
 ,  as defined in (\ref{nk1}), is a count of the probes reaching  that counts each probe once and once only regardless of how many receivers observe the probe. Therefore,   is a minimal sufficient statistic in regard to the observation of .
\end{IEEEproof}

\subsection{Statistics considering a part of observation}
\label{mlestatistics}
Instead of using  to estimate , we can use , defined in Section \ref{mlesection} to estimate . The difference between them is the number of correlations considered in estimation, where the latter  is smaller than the former. As (\ref{likelihood function}),  is needed to express the pass rate of the subtrees consisting of . Given  and , we can also write a likelihood function of  and use the same procedure as that in Section \ref{mlesection} to prove  a sufficient statistic in the context of the observation obtained by . Further, an estimator on the observation of  can be created that will be discussed in Section \ref{section 4}.

\section{Estimator Analysis} \label{section3}
This section is dedicate to the analysis of the MLE that considers all of the correlations available in observation. By the analysis, we are able to identify all of the correlations in observation and find the connections among them that will set up the foundation for various explicit estimators.

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood Estimator based on } \label{2.a}

Turning the likelihood function presented in (\ref{likelihood function}) into a log-likelihood function, we have
 
 Differentiating (\ref{likelihood}) {\it wrt.} 
and letting the derivatives be 0, we have


and then

Since neither  nor  can be solved from (\ref{AkBk}), we need to consider other correlations and then derive a MLE.
Given the {\it i.i.d.} model assumed previously and the multicast used in probing, we have the following equation to link the observation of  to 

Solving  from (\ref{beta-k}) and using it in (\ref{likelihood equation}), we have a MLE as

Using  to replace  since the latter is the empirical value of the former, we have a likelihood equation as follows:

that is identical to the estimator proposed in \cite{CDHT99}.



\subsection{Predictor and  Observation}



 To make the correlations involved in (\ref{realmle1}) visible,  we expand  the left hand side (LHS) and the right hand side (RHS) of  (\ref{realmle1}), where the terms obtained from the LHS are called observations and the terms from the RHS are called correlations. The correlation is also called  the {\it predictor} since it predicates the observation received in an experiment.  For instance,  is the predictor of the probes simultaneously observed by the receivers attached to subtree  and subtree , i.e. there is at least one receiver from each subtree. 

To represent the correlations involved in (\ref{realmle1}),
 a -algebra, , is created over  and  let  be the non-empty sets in . Each member in  corresponds to a pair of a predictor and its observation.  If  the number of elements in a member of  is defined as the degree of the correlation,  can be divided into  exclusive groups, one for
 a degree of correlations that vary from 1 degree to  degree. Let  denote the group that considers  degree correlations. For example, if ,  consists of the pairwise correlations in , and  contains all of the triplet-wise correlations.


Given ,   can be decomposed into the probes that are observed simultaneously by the members of   that is defined as if  and , a probe observed by   if and only if at least a receiver attached to subtree  observes the probe. We call such an observation simultaneous observation.
 To explicitly express  by ,   is introduced to return  the number of probes observed simultaneously by   in an experiment.
Let  be the observation of  for probe  that is defined as:

then

If ,

Given the above,  can be decomposed as:


(\ref{n_k value}) states that  is equal to a series of  that are overlapped each other. To ensure each probe observed by  is counted once and once only in , we need to use the alternating adding and subtracting operations to eliminate duplication.


\subsection{Correspondence between Predictors and Observations}

Given  (\ref{n_k value}), we are able to prove the MLE proposed in \cite{CDHT99} considers all of the correlations in  and have the following theorem.

\begin{theorem} \label{minctheorem}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (\ref{realmle1}) is a full likelihood estimator that considers all of the correlations in ;
\item (\ref{realmle1}) consists of  observed values and their predictors, one for a member of ; and
\item the estimate obtained from (\ref{realmle1})  is a fit that minimises an alternating differences between observed values and corresponding predictors.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
(\ref{realmle1}) is a full likelihood estimator that considers all of the correlations in . To prove 2) and 3),  we expand the both sides of (\ref{realmle1}) to pair the observed values with the  predictors of them according to . We take three steps to achieve the goal.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  If  we use (\ref{n_k value}) to replace  from LHS of (\ref{realmle1}),  the LHS becomes:

\item If we expand the product term located on  the RHS of (\ref{realmle1}), we have:
 where the alternative adding and subtracting operations intend to remove the impact of redundant observation.
\item Deducting 1 from both (\ref{nkexpansion}) and (\ref{prodexpansion})
and then multiplying the results by , (\ref{realmle1}) turns to

It is clear there is a correspondence between the terms across
the equal sign, where the terms on the LHS are the observed values and the terms on the RHS are the predictors. If we rewrite
(\ref{statequal}) as

\end{enumerate}
the correspondence between correlations and observed values becomes obvious.
\end{IEEEproof}

To distinguish the MLE from those proposed in this paper, we call it original MLE in the rest of the paper.















\section{Explicit Estimators based on Composite Likelihood} \label{section 4}
(\ref{correspondence}) shows that the original MLE takes into account all of the correlations in . If the number of subtrees rooted at node  is larger than 6, the estimator is a high degree polynomial that could not be solved analytically. To have an explicit estimator in those circumstances, we need to reduce the number of correlations considered in estimation and there are a number of strategies to achieve this. We here propose three of them and use composite likelihood that  is also called
pseudo-likelihood by Besag in \cite{Besay74} to create likelihood functions for the strategies. The three strategies are named  reduce scaled, block-wised, and individual based, respectively. The reduce scaled strategy, as named, is a small version of the original MLE that selectively removes a  number of subtrees rooted at node  from consideration and then uses the maximum likelihood principle on the rest to estimate . The block-wised strategy differs from the reduce scaled one by dividing all available correlations considered by the original MLE into a number of blocks, one for a degree of correlations, from pairwise to -wise. The individual based one,  in contrast to the other two, considers a correlation at a time that leads to a large number of estimators.

\subsection{Reduce Scaled Estimator (RSE)}

Rather than considering all of the correlations in , the correlations can be divided into groups according to the subtrees rooted at node . Let  be the group to be considered by an estimator in RSE. The log-likelihood function considering the correlations  is as follows:
 
 where  as defined in \ref{mlestatistics} is the number of probes reaching node  confirmed from the observations of the receivers attached to  and
  is the pass rate of   that can be expressed as

Then, a similar likelihood equation as (\ref{realmle1}) is obtained and presented as follows:

If , the equation is solvable analytically. The estimators in RSE are denoted by .

\subsection{Block-wised Estimator (BWE)}


(\ref{correspondence}) shows that the correlations involved in the original MLE can be divided into  blocks, from pairwise to -wise.  Each of them can be written as a likelihood function. In order to use a unique likelihood function for all of them, we let the likelihood function considering single correlation be 1. Then, the -wise likelihood function denoted as  can be expressed uniformly.



\begin{definition} \label{recursive corollary}
There are a number of composite likelihood functions, one for a degree of correlations, varying from pairwise to -wise. The composite likelihood function   has a  form as follows:


 \end{definition}
 Let  be the estimator derived from . Then,  we have the following theorem.
\begin{theorem} \label{all explicit}
Each of the composite likelihood
equations obtained from (\ref{recursive form}) is an explicit estimator of  that is as follows:

\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
Firstly, we can write (\ref{recursive form}) into a log-likelihood function and differentiate the log-likelihood function {\it wrt} . As (\ref{AkBk}), we cannot solve  or  directly from the derivative and we need to consider other correlations as (\ref{beta-k}). We then have an equation as
 The two summations can be expanded as (\ref{realmle1}) and only the terms related to the i-wise correlation left  since all other terms in the first summation are canceled by the terms of the second summation. The likelihood equation as (\ref{approximateestimator}) follows.
\end{IEEEproof}
In the rest of the paper,  is used to refer to the  estimator and  refers to the estimate obtained by .


\subsection{Individual based Estimator (IBE)}

Instead of considering a block of correlations together, we can consider a correlation at at time and have a large number of estimators. Each of them has a similar likelihood function as (\ref{likelihood RSE}), where  and  are replaced by  and , respectively. , is the pass rate of . If  is the correlations considered by IBE, the log-likelihood function for  given observation  is equal to
 
 We then have the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}  \label{local estimator}
Given (\ref{Al likelihood1}),  is a Bernoulli process. The MLE for  given  equals to

\end{theorem}
	\begin{IEEEproof} Using the same procedure as that used in \ref{2.a}, we have the theorem.
\end{IEEEproof}


Comparing (\ref{approximateestimator}) with (\ref{local estimator1}), we can find that , where , is a type of geometric mean and  is the arithmetic mean of . Therefore,  is more robust than .

Using and combining the strategies presented here, we can have various explicit estimators that cover those proposed previously. For instance, the estimator proposed in \cite{ADV07, Zhu11a} is one of them that divides  into two groups and only considers the pairwise correlations between the members of the two groups. Therefore, although the estimator proposed in \cite{ADV07, Zhu11a} is a MLE in terms of the observation used in estimation, it is not the same as (\ref{minc}).


\section{Properties of the Estimators} \label{section5}

 It is known that if a MLE is a function of the sufficient statistic, it is asymptotically unbiased, consistent and asymptotically efficient. Thus, the original MLE and
all of the estimators proposed in this paper have the properties. Apart from them, we are interested in whether some of the estimators have better properties
 than them, such as, unbiasedness, uniqueness, variance, and efficiency, that can be used to evaluate the estimators. This section is devoted to present them that consist of a number of  theorems and corollaries.

\subsection{Unbiasedness and Uniqueness of  and }
This subsection is focused on the unbiasedness of the estimators in IBE and BWE although the statistic used by the latter is not minimal sufficient. For , we have the following theorem.

 \begin{theorem} \label{local maximum}
 is a unbiased estimator.
\end{theorem}

\begin{IEEEproof}
Let  be the pass rate of  and let   be the sample mean of . Note that  and  are independent from each other if . In addition,  is independent from . Because of this,  is used to replace  in the following derivation since the latter is equal to  that is equal to . We then have




The theorem follows.
\end{IEEEproof}
Given theorem \ref{local maximum}, we have the follow corollary.
 \begin{corollary} \label{global expect}
  is a unbiased estimator.
 \end{corollary}
    \begin{IEEEproof}
According to theorem \ref{local maximum}, we have

\end{IEEEproof}

Given  and  are unbiased estimators,
we can prove the uniqueness of .










\begin{theorem}
If

there is only one solution in  for .
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
Since the support of  is in (0,1), we can reach this conclusion from (\ref{approximateestimator}).
\end{IEEEproof}










\subsection{Efficiency of  , , and the original MLE}
Apart from  asymptotically efficiency stated previously for the MLEs using sufficient statistics, we are interested in the efficiency of the estimators proposed in this paper. Given (\ref{Al likelihood1}), we have the following theorem for the Fisher information of an observation, , for the estimators in IBE, i.e. .
\begin{theorem} \label{Al fisher}
The Fisher information of  on  is equal to .
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
Considering  is the observation of the receivers attached to , we have the following as the likelihood function of the observation:

Differentiating (\ref{Al likelihood for single}) {\it wrt} , we have

We then have

If  is used to denote the Fisher information of observation  for  in , we  have

that is the information provided by  for .
\end{IEEEproof}
Given (\ref{fisher}), we are able to have a formula for the Fisher information of the original MLE and the estimators in RSE. In order to achieve this, let . Then, we have the following corollary.
\begin{corollary} \label{MLE fisher}
The Fisher information of observation  for  in the original MLE and  is equal to

\end{corollary}
\begin{IEEEproof}
Replacing  or  by  and replacing  or  by  from (\ref{likelihood}) and (\ref{likelihood RSE}), respectively, and then using the same procedure as that used in the proof of theorem \ref{Al fisher}, the corollary follows.
\end{IEEEproof}
Because of the similarity between (\ref{fisher}) and (\ref{MLE fisher equ}), the two equations have the same features in terms of support, singularity, and maximums. After
eliminating the singular points, the support of  is in  and the support of  (or ) is in .
Both (\ref{fisher}) and (\ref{MLE fisher equ}) are convex functions in the support and reach the maximum at the points of   (or () and  (or ().
Given , (\ref{MLE fisher equ}) is  a monotonic increase function of  whereas (\ref{fisher}) is a monotonic increase function of . 

Despite the similarity between (\ref{fisher}) and (\ref{MLE fisher equ}),   and  react differently if  is replaced by  in terms of efficiency that leads to two corollaries, one for each of them.
\begin{corollary}
 is more efficient than  if .
\end{corollary}
\begin{IEEEproof}
If ,  and then we have the corollary.
\end{IEEEproof}
For , we have
\begin{corollary} 
The efficiency of  forms a partial order that is identical to that formed on the inclusion of the members in , where the most efficient estimator must be one of the  and the least efficient one must be .
\label{Al corollary}
\end{corollary}
\begin{IEEEproof}
According to Theorem \ref{Al fisher}, the efficiency of  is determined by , where . If , we have
 .
 Therefore, the order of the efficiency of  shares that of the inclusion in , where  are the members of  that have the minimal number of elements.
 In contrast to ,  since . Then, the corollary follows.
\end{IEEEproof}

\subsection{Variance of , , and the original MLE}
The estimator specified by (\ref{minc}),  , and  are of MLEs that have different focuses on the observations obtained. Despite the difference between them, they share a number of features, including likelihood function and efficient equation. In addition, the variances of them are expressed by a general function showing the connection between  and the pass rate of the subtree considered in estimation. Let  denote all of them. Then, we have a theorem for the variances of the estimators in .

\begin{theorem} \label{Al variance}
The variances of the estimators in  equal to

where 

\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
The passing process described by (\ref{Al likelihood1}) is a Bernoulli process that falls into the exponential family and satisfies the regularity conditions presented in \cite{Joshi76}. Thus, the variance of  an estimator in  reaches the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound that is the reciprocal of the Fisher information.
\end{IEEEproof}
(\ref{Al variance1}) can be written as

which shows:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item the estimates obtained by an estimator spread out more widely than that obtained by direct measurement. The wideness is determined by , the pass rate of the subtrees connecting node  to observers. If , there is no further spread-out than that obtained by direct measurement. Otherwise, the variance increases as the decreases of  and in a super linear fashion.
\item
the variance of the estimates obtained by an estimator is monotonically increasing as the depth of the subtree rooted at node  since the pass rate of a subtree decreases as its depth, i.e., the pass rate of an -level tree, say A, is larger than that of the -level one that is extended from the -level one;
\item the variance of the estimates  obtained by an estimator in  is a monotonically decreasing function of . 
\end{enumerate}
The three points confirm some of the experiment results reported previously, such as the dependency of variance on topology reported in \cite{CDHT99}. Note than despite 3), the variance of  can be the same as that of  if . So does . In other words, if the probes observed by  are included in that observed by , the estimate obtained by  is the same as that obtained by .



\subsection{Efficiency and Variance of BWE}

As stated, the estimate obtained by  is a type of the arithmetic mean of  that has the same advantages and disadvantages as the arithmetic mean. Thus,  is more robust and efficient than that of  since the former considers more probes than the latter in estimation although some of the probes may be considered more than once. Because of this, (\ref{fisher}) cannot be used to evaluate the efficiency of an estimator in BWE. Despite this, we can put a range for the information obtained by  that is
 
In addition,  is at least as efficient as  and the variance of  is at least as small as that of  since .



\subsection{Example}
We use an example to conclude this section that illustrate the differences of the variances obtained from the estimates of four estimators. The four estimators are: direct measurement, the original MLE,  and , respectively. The setting used here is identical to that presented in \cite{DHPT06}, where node  has three children with a pass
rate of , and the pass rate from the root to node  is also equal to .  Using (\ref{Al variance1}), we have the variances of them that are presented below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ,
\item ,
\item , and
\item .
\end{enumerate}
The difference between them becomes obvious as  decreases from  to  , where the variances of the four estimators change from 0 to 0.01, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively. The variance of  is 4 times of that of the original MLE that is significantly different from that obtained in \cite{DHPT06}. Although the variances are decreased as the number of probes multicasted, the ratio between them remains.

\section{Model Selection and Simulation} \label{section 6}
The large number of estimators in IBE, RSE and BWE, plus the original MLE, make model selection possible. However, to find the most suitable one in terms of efficiency and computational complexity is a hard task since the two goals conflict each other. Although one is able to identify the the most suitable estimator by computing the Kullback-Leigh divergence or the composite Kullback-Leigh divergence of the estimators, the cost of computing the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each of the estimators makes this approach prohibitive.  Nevertheless, the derivation of (\ref{MLE fisher equ}) successfully solves the problem in some degree since (\ref{MLE fisher equ}) shows the most suitable estimator should have a bigger  which can be obtained from end-to-end observation since .

\subsection{Simulation}

To compare the effectiveness, robustness, and sensitivity of the estimators between the original MLE, , and , three rounds of simulations are conducted in three settings. The multicast tree used in the simulations having a path/link from the root to node  that has 8 subtrees connecting to the receivers. Five estimators: the original MLE (OMLE), ,  and , are compared against each other in the simulation. The number of samples used in the simulations varies from 300 to 2700 in a step of 600. For each sample size, 20 experiments with different initial seeds are carried out and the means and variances of the estimates obtained by the five estimators are presented in three tables, from Table \ref{Tab2} to Table \ref{Tab4}.

 Table \ref{Tab2} is the results obtained in the first round that sets the loss rate of the subtrees to 1\%, so does the loss rate of the path from the root to node .  The result shows when the sample size is small, the estimates obtained by all estimators are drifted away from the true value that indicates the data obtained is not enough. With the increase of sample size, the estimates gradually approach to the true value and all of the estimators achieve a  similar outcome. As expected, the variances decrease as the sample size that is agreed with (\ref{Al variance1}) and there is no significant difference among the estimators since all of the subtrees connected to node  have the same loss rates. Despite this, the variance of  is slightly better than that of  as specified by Theorem \ref{Al variance}.


To compare the sensitivity and robustness, another round simulation is carried out on the same network.
 The difference between this round and the previous one is the loss rates of the subtrees connected to node , where 6 of the 8 subtrees have their loss rates equal to  and the other two have their loss rates equal to . The two subtrees
  considered by  have the loss rates equal to  and , respectively; whereas the two of the three subtrees considered by  have their loss rates equal to  and the other has its loss rate equals to . The results are presented in Table \ref{Tab3}. Compared Table \ref{Tab3} with Table \ref{Tab2}, there is no change for the original MLE and there are slight changes for the estimates obtained by  and . That confirms the robustness of the original MLE and the  over . In contrast to the original MLE and , the variances of the estimates obtained by  and   have noticeable differences with their counterparts, in particular  if the sample size is small because each of the estimators has a descendant with a higher loss rate than that used in the first round.  The advantage of this shows at the mean obtained by  that
 approaches to the true value quicker than that in the first round and that of .  This is because one of the two descendants considered by  has a higher loss rate than the other that increases the probability of  matching the predicator to its observation. In contrast to , the mean of  has little change from that obtained in the first round. This reflects the tradeoff between efficiency and robustness among , where the larger the  is, the robuster the  is to the turbulence of the loss rates in . 
 To have a similar result as the original MLE, we should select  the subtrees that have loss rates equating to  for  or . Then, the same result as that presented in Table \ref{Tab2} should be obtained.

To verify the claim made at the end of last paragraph, we  conduct another round simulation, where the loss rate of the path of interest is increased from  to , and the loss rates of the eight subtrees rooted at node  are divided into two groups, four of them are set to  and the other four to .  The two estimators from IBE, i.e.  and , consider the observations obtained from the subtrees that have their loss rates equal to . The result is presented in Table \ref{Tab4} that confirms the estimates of  can be as good as that of the OMLE.  In comparison with
Table \ref{Tab2}, there are two noticeable differences in Table \ref{Tab4} :
 \begin{itemize}
 \item the means of the estimates approach to the true value quicker; and
 \item the  variances are a magnitude higher.
  \end{itemize}
The first can be derived from Theorem \ref{Al fisher}  and Corollary \ref{MLE fisher} since the efficiency of an estimator is inversely proportional to ; whereas the second can be obtained from  Theorem \ref{Al variance} that states a smaller  results in a bigger variance.



The simulations show that the original MLE undoultly is the most robust estimator that fits all of the three situations well although it reacts slower than some of the estimators proposed in this paper to the variation of observation. In contrast,  there is always an estimator that has a similar performance as that of the MLE in each of the situations. 
 The findings of this paper make it  possible to identify a suitable estimator according to end-to-end observation.















\section{Conclusion}\label{section7}

This paper starts from finding inspirations that can lead to efficient explicit estimators for loss tomography and ends with a large number of unbiased or asymptotic unbiased and consistent explicit estimators, plus a number of theorems and corollaries to assure the statistical properties of the estimators. One of the most important findings is of the formulae to compute the variances of  estimated by the estimators in RSE, IBE and the original MLE. Apart from clearly expressing the connection between the path to be estimated and the subtrees connecting the path to the observers of interest, the formulae potentially have many applications in network tomography, some have been identified in this paper.  For instance, using the formulae, we have ranked the MLEs proposed so far, including those proposed  in this paper. In addition, the formulae make model selection possible in loss tomography and then the multicast used in end-to-end measurement is no longer only for creating various correlations but also for identifying the subtrees that can be used in estimation. The effectiveness of the strategy has been verified in a simulation study. Apart from those, there are other potentials to use the formulae and the findings that require further exploration.
