\section{Introduction}

This short example shows a contrived example on how to format the authors' information for {\it IJCAI--19 Proceedings}.

\section{Author names}

Each author name must be followed by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A newline {\tt \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}} command for the last author.
    \item An {\tt \textbackslash{}And} command for the second to last author.
    \item An {\tt \textbackslash{}and} command for the other authors.
\end{itemize}

\section{Affiliations}

After all authors, start the affiliations section by using the {\tt \textbackslash{}affiliations} command.
Each affiliation must be terminated by a newline {\tt \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}} command. Make sure that you include the newline on the last affiliation too.

\section{Mapping authors to affiliations}

If some scenarios, the affiliation of each author is clear without any further indication (\emph{e.g.}, all authors share the same affiliation, all authors have a single and different affiliation). In these situations you don't need to do anything special.

In more complex scenarios you will have to clearly indicate the affiliation(s) for each author. This is done by using numeric math superscripts {\tt \$\{\^{}$i,j, \ldots$\}\$}. You must use numbers, not symbols, because those are reserved for footnotes in this section (should you need them). Check the authors definition in this example for reference.

\section{Emails}

This section is optional, and can be omitted entirely if you prefer. If you want to include e-mails, you should either include all authors' e-mails or just the contact author(s)' ones.

Start the e-mails section with the {\tt \textbackslash{}emails} command. After that, write all emails you want to include separated by a comma and a space, following the same order used for the authors (\emph{i.e.}, the first e-mail should correspond to the first author, the second e-mail to the second author and so on).

You may ``contract" consecutive e-mails on the same domain as shown in this example (write the users' part within curly brackets, followed by the domain name). Only e-mails of the exact same domain may be contracted. For instance, contracting ``person@example.com" and ``other@test.example.com" is not allowed because the domains are different.
