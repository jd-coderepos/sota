\begin{abstract}
Recognizing interactive action plays an important role in human-robot interaction and collaboration. Previous methods use late fusion and co-attention mechanism to capture interactive relations, which have limited learning capability or inefficiency to adapt to more interacting entities. With assumption that priors of each entity are already known, they also lack evaluations on a more general setting addressing the diversity of subjects. To address these problems, we propose an Interactive Spatiotemporal Token Attention Network (ISTA-Net), which simultaneously model spatial, temporal, and interactive relations. Specifically, our network contains a tokenizer to partition Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens (ISTs), which is a unified way to represent motions of multiple diverse entities. By extending the entity dimension, ISTs provide better interactive representations. To jointly learn along three dimensions in ISTs, multi-head self-attention blocks integrated with 3D convolutions are designed to capture inter-token correlations. When modeling correlations, a strict entity ordering is usually irrelevant for recognizing interactive actions. To this end, Entity Rearrangement is proposed to eliminate the orderliness in ISTs for interchangeable entities. Extensive experiments on four datasets verify the effectiveness of ISTA-Net by outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Necolizer/ISTA-Net}.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Interactive action recognition is a crucial yet challenging task in computer vision and physical human-robot interaction\cite{9636389,9636110,zheng2017image,DBLP:conf/iros/XingB22}, with a wide range of applications like assistive household robots\cite{9636381} and interactive mechanical arms\cite{7554295}. These smart assistants should understand interactive motion patterns and the intents behind actions to ensure safe and reliable human-robot collaboration\cite{9636107,9636553}.

An interactive action is a purposeful behavior that involves the interdependent physical dynamics of multiple entities. The indivisibility of interdependent entities distinguish interactive actions from \textit{individual actions} and \textit{group activities}. Individual actions (Fig. \ref{InteractiveActons} (a)) are concerned with motions of a single subject. Group activities (Fig. \ref{InteractiveActons} (b)) are events concluded or abstracted from common goals of actions, which contain considerable irrelevant and noisy individual actions. In contrast, each subject in an interactive action is indispensable to illustrate the full semantic meaning. Types of interactive actions includes person-to-person, hand-to-hand, hand-to-object. Diverse interacting entities have distinct physical structures and interaction patterns, leading to the complexity and variability when modeling interactions.

(a) Sequences of single pose could fully depict the action \textit{Jump Up}. (b) Group activity \textit{Waiting} is annotated regardless of the pedestrians. (c) Each entity is an integral part of the interactive action. Previous methods focus on one type of these interactions. (d) In this paper, we evaluate on general interactive action recognition task, which addresses the diversity of interacting subjects.}
    \label{InteractiveActons}

\end{figure}

Studies on modeling interactive actions have emerged in recent years\cite{H+O2019, H2O_TA-GCN2021, LSTM-IRN2022, igformer2022}, but they study only one specific type of interactions depicted in Fig. \ref{InteractiveActons} (c). They also assume that prior knowledge of the physical connections within each interacting subject is already known and remains fixed. Therefore, these methods lack evaluations in a general setting addressing the diversity of interacting entities. \uline{In this paper, we focus on a general interactive action recognition task, which is a generalization from the subject-type-specific ones, as shown in Fig. \ref{InteractiveActons} (d).} Moreover, previous designs have limitations when capturing interactive relations. Late fusion offers a simplistic approach for modeling interactive relations, but it lacks the capacity to handle complex interactions. On the other hand, expanding the co-attention architecture to accommodate more than two interacting entities is inefficient, due to the increase in the number of calculations required for pair-wise co-attention scores, as the number of entities increases. Therefore, an important question arises: \uline{How to jointly learn the spatial, temporal, and interactive relations of diverse interacting subjects?}

To answer this question, we simultaneously model entity, temporal and spatial relations between interacting entities with an Interactive Spatiotemporal Token Attention Network (ISTA-Net), whose core component is the Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokenization. 3D Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens (ISTs) can be generated by this tokenization, which is a unified way to represent motions of multiple diverse entities. To learn inter-token correlations, we integrate 3D convolutions with self-attention and design Token Self-Attention (TSA) Blocks. Moreover, the ordering of unordered entities in ISTs is unnecessary for modeling correlations. We propose Entity Rearrangement (ER) to solve this problem.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{We propose an Interactive Spatiotemporal Token Attention Network to solve the general interactive action recognition task, which does not require prior knowledge on subject's physical structure.}
\item{Specifically, we present Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens to fuse three dimensional interactive spatiotemporal features, for effectively representing spatiotemporal interactions for diverse entities. We present Token Self-Attention Blocks for better capturing correlations of different interactive features. Moreover, Entity rearrangement is proposed to ensure inherent permutation invariance for unordered entities in ISTs.}
\item{Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 120, SBU-Kinect-Interaction, H2O and Assembly101 datasets consistently verify the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms most interactive action recognition methods. Our code is publicly available.}

\section{RELATED WORK}
\subsection{Action Recognition}
Most skeleton-based action recognition methods focus on developing effective architectures to recognize individual actions. Early approaches\cite{Co-LSTM2016,ST-LSTM2016, GCA2017, VA-LSTM2017, 2s-GCA2018} adopted RNN or LSTM to model long-term context of skeleton sequences. Then many models based on Graph Convolution Network (GCN) were proposed\cite{ST-GCN2018,AS-GCN2019, 2s-AGCN2019,MS-G3D2020,CTR-GCN2021,LST2022,tcagcn2022,hdgcn2022,InfoGCN2022}. To facilitate modeling channel-wise topologies, CTR-GCN \cite{CTR-GCN2021} learns a shared topology for all channels and refines it for each channel. InfoGCN\cite{InfoGCN2022} adopts a novel learning objective to learn compact latent representations. Recent works explored the protential to introduce self-attention mechanism into skeleton spatiotemporal modeling\cite{dstanet2020,STSA-Net2023}. For instance, STSA-Net\cite{STSA-Net2023} adopted a spatiotemporal segments encoding strategy to fuse joint relations between frames. 

\subsection{Interactive Action Recognition}
Recently-proposed interactive action recognition models \cite{H+O2019,H2O_TA-GCN2021,LSTM-IRN2022,igformer2022} capture interactions based on specially-designed modules according to subject priors. TA-GCN \cite{H2O_TA-GCN2021} models the hand-to-object relationship with a topology-aware graph convolutional network, in which prior graph dependencies of hands are predefined. For person-to-person mutual actions, LSTM-IRN \cite{LSTM-IRN2022} adopts relational reasoning over the different relationships between the human joints during interactions. IGFormer \cite{igformer2022} is the first to adopt Transformer-based architecture and leverages prior knowledge on human body structure to design co-attention mechanism for interactions. Different from above methods, our method utilizes Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens as early fusions for modeling interactive spatiotemporal features, which also allows ISTA-Net to be able to handle various interactions, such as person-to-person, hand-to-hand, and hand-to-object interactions, with no need to manually predefine adjacency based on subject-type-specific prior knowledge.

\section{ISTA-Net}

Architecture of our proposed Interactive Spatiotemporal Token Attention Network is presented in Fig. \ref{method}. The input is an interactive action, which can be constituted by different types of entity. Firstly, ISTA-Net performs Entity Rearrangement in training to maintain the equivalence of unordered subjects. Subsequently the skeleton tensor gets tokenized by a 3D sliding window. Then the interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens are fed to \textit{L} Token Self-Attention Blocks to learn token-level interdependency. Prediction is finally made through Global Average Pooling (GAP) along ISTs following with a fully connected (FC) layer.

\subsection{Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokenization for Interactive Skeleton Sequences}

An important aspect of ISTA-Net is the design of attention tokens that represent interactive spatiotemporal local features for interactive skeleton sequences. We propose a general solution to represent motion of multiple skeletons including diverse subjects, without the assumption that priors of each interacting entity are already known.

Suppose that there are  interactive entities performing an interaction over a period of time , and each entity contains  joints. Depending on whether 2D or 3D skeletons are estimated, the coordinate dimension  can be 2 or 3. Thereby the input skeleton sequence is defined as . In comparison to individual actions, interactive actions have an additional dimension  representing interactive entity parts or joints, which must be taken into consideration when tokenizing the skeletal data.

Our solution is to use non-overlapping 3D windows to obtain Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens. This step is called Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokenization (IST) Block. Given a window  of size , it slides along temporal, spatial and interactive dimensions, partitioning the input data in a non-overlapping manner. Therefore, the input of size  is divided into  patches of size  in total, which is illustrated as follows:

where  and .

The tokens  can be viewed in , which could be illustrated more clearly as the standard Transformer input format. However, in this case, we retain the coordinate dimension  and temporal dimension  for downsampling and temporal aggregation in later stages.

In some cases, such as in the  channel, the input size  may not be evenly divisible by the window size . In such cases, parts of the original tensor should be replicated and padded along the  dimension to create a new tensor of size  in time channel, where  is an aliquot part of .

To enrich the representation in coordinates, a 3D  convolution is employed to extend the coordinate dimension from  to , which could be formulated as

where .

The 3D convolution operation, followed by the batch normalization and an activation function, serves as the embedding layer for interactive spatiotemporal tokens. Finally these tokens  are fed to several Multi-head Self-attention Blocks to learn high-level cross frame, joint and subject representations.

\subsection{Entity Rearrangement}
When partitioning ISTs as well as encoding positional information, the presence of a strict entity ordering can impede learning's ability to generalize to more cases. Specifically, for interactive entities engaged in mutual actions, some are semantically ordered and not interchangeable (e.g. left hand, right hand and object), while others are unordered and interchangeable (e.g. persons). The semantic equivalence of mutual subjects implies that the unordered entities are permutation-invariant. They can be arranged in any order while still representing the same interactive action.

This observation inspires us a simple yet effective way to eliminate the orderliness of interchangeable entities. Given the input skeleton sequence of size , we first divide it into  parts along interactive dimension, obviously each of which represents the joint motion of one subject:

where  are indexes of the positional order along interactive dimension.

We could rearrange the original  as follows:

where  is an arbitrary arrangement of indexes .

Line 7-11 refer to tensor padding. Line 12-15 refer to tokenziation using 3D windows. Line 16-17 represent embedding layers.

During each training epoch, an input permutation  is selected, while in validation and testing, the original input  is used. The total number of possible permutations for entities is , indicating that each permutation has a probability of  to be chosen as input. A theoretical concern is that the factorial increase in the number of samples may lead to non-convergent training. However, in practice,  is typically small, since in most cases, there are not many mutual subjects in a single interactive action.

\subsection{Token Self-Attention Blocks}
To model the spatial, temporal, and interactive relationships simultaneously, our architecture incorporates a multi-head self-attention mechanism instead of a graph-convolution-based design. Unlike many GCNs, which require manual definition of an adjacency list for every joint based on prior knowledge of the physical connections between joints, our proposed architecture omits this tedious step for diverse action subjects. This also provides a unified approach to recognize interactive actions of diverse subjects .

Our proposed ISTA-Net consists of  Token Self-Attention Blocks. Similar to standard multi-head self-attention, the input  transforms to multiple sets of query , key  and value  as follows:  



where positional encoding implemented with circular functions is denoted as . The number of sets, namely heads, is denoted as .

Self-attention scores  of the -th head could be calculated as the following formula:

where  is divided by the square root of the feature length . A trainable regularized matrix  is added to the normalized attention map with a trainable balanced factor , which can benefit correlation learning\cite{dstanet2020,STSA-Net2023}. All scores  of  heads are concatenated to get . 

In some TSA Blocks, the  dimension is doubled to downsample the features (), while in the others it remains the same ():


where a 3D  convolution with residual connections implements the feed forward network (FFN).

The last component is the Temporal Aggregation (TA) layer. Previous researches\cite{tcagcn2022,hdgcn2022} indicate that feature aggregation along temporal channel is effective for modeling actions. In contrast to those methods, the proposed ISTA-Net uses 3D convolution with kernel sizes larger than 1 in the temporal dimension () to aggregate sequence features:

which is followed by a residual connection .

\section{EXPERIMENTS}
\subsection{Datasets}

\textbf{NTU RGB+D 120}\cite{NTU120}, the extension version of \textbf{NTU RGB+D}\cite{NTU60}, is a widely-used action recognition dataset. It provides 114,480 samples of 120 human actions. In our experiments we focus on a subset of NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset, which consists of 26 kinds of mutual actions (named \textbf{NTU Mutual}, for short). 

\textbf{SBU-Kinect-Interaction}\cite{SBU} is a human activity
dataset that depicts person-to-person interactions. It includes eight interactions, with RGB+D videos and extracted skeletons.

\textbf{H2O}\cite{H2O_TA-GCN2021} is the first dataset constructured for egocentric 3D interaction recognition. With 3D pose of both hands and pose of manipulated objects, H2O dataset facilitates hand-to-hand and hand-to-object interactions understanding.

\textbf{Assembly101}\cite{Assembly101} is a large procedural activity dataset. 3D hand poses are provided to advance 3D interaction recognition from egocentric views. It's a tough task due to the dataset's complexity, which includes over 1,300 fine-grained classes of hand-to-object interactions. Each class consists of a single verb and an object that is manipulated. Additionally, the absence of object poses adds another layer of difficulty to judging the interactive actions.

Statistics and difficulties of these datasets are summarized in Table \ref{dataset} and Fig. \ref{datasetviz}. For evaluation on NTU Mutual, we employ the Cross-subject (X-Sub) and Cross-set (X-Set) criteria \cite{NTU120}, using only the joint modality to ensure fair comparisons without fusion. For SBU, the suggested 5-fold cross validation approach \cite{SBU} is adopted. For H2O and Assembly101, we follow the training, validation, and test splits described in \cite{H2O_TA-GCN2021} and \cite{Assembly101}, respectively.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
All of our experiments are conducted on a machine equipped with four GeForce RTX 3070 GPUs and CUDA version 11.4. For training on NTU Mutual dataset, SGD optimizer is used with Nesterov momentum of 0.9, a initial learning rate of 0.1 and a decay rate 0.1. Window size is set to [20, 1, 2]. Cross entropy is used as loss function with label smoothing factor 0.1 and temperature factor 1.0. Batch size is 32. Each training process was terminated after 110 epochs. Parameters for the other datasets might be different. Please refer to the configurations in our Github repository. 

\subsection{Comparison with Related Methods}

Table \ref{sota} reports the experimental results on NTU Mutual, SBU, H2O and Assembly101 datasets. The proposed ISTA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other traditional action recognition and interactive action recognition methods. Benefitting from the proposed ISTs, TSA Blocks and ER, ISTA-Net outperforms many LSTM-, GCN-, and Transformer-based action recognition methods. ISTA-Net achieves 5.16\%, 5.22\%, 0.11\% and 5.68\% gains over the most related interactive action recognition method, IGFormer\cite{igformer2022}, on NTU Mutual X-Sub, X-Set, SBU and Assembly101. ISTA-Net also outperforms InfoGCN\cite{InfoGCN2022} by 0.34\% and 0.59\% on NTU Mutual, TA-GCN\cite{H2O_TA-GCN2021} by 9.84\% on H2O, and MS-G3D\cite{MS-G3D2020} by 1.15\% on Assembly101. Observed from the results, our ISTA-Net also show its superiority and adaptability to diverse interactive entities. Fig. \ref{Viz} visualizes the learnt attention in the last TSA Block, which verifies the effectiveness of ISTA-Net when modeling interactive actions.

The attentive weights are visualized to illustrate the important body parts involved in recognizing different interactive actions. Specifically, ISTA-Net recognizes the \textit{Punch} action through attentions on the attacker's hands and the victim's limbs. The \textit{Hugging} action is recognized through attentions on the approaching and contacting body parts. The \textit{Giving Object} action is recognized through attentions on the hands.}

\textbf{Comparison of Ways to Fuse Interactive Relations.} We compare four approaches to model the interactive relations of spatiotemporal features. The first approach, called \textit{Late Fusion}, is widely used in traditional action recognition methods when adapting to interactive skeletons. In \textit{Late Fusion}, interactions are only modeled in the classification head. The second one, \textit{Co-attention}, employs weight-shared dual-branch self-attention blocks. In each block,  and  are got from the previous block in this branch, while  is obtain from the other branch. The third approach, \textit{Coordinate Concat}, directly concatenates entity features along coordinate dimension. The last one is our proposed \textit{IST}, which fuses interactive features during early tokenization. Compared to the others, an additional dimension  is extended in this method. Table \ref{ablation1} demonstrates that \textit{IST} outperforms the other approaches by 1.77\%, 0.78\% and 2.42\%.

\textbf{Effectiveness of Entity Rearrangement.} We explore the effectiveness of Entity Rearrangement by removing this step. As reported in Table \ref{ablation2}, the performance declined on the relatively larger NTU Mutual dataset, and more significantly on the relatively smaller SBU dataset. This indicates that ER is beneficial for enhancing model generalization, particularly when training with small-scale data.

\textbf{Effectiveness of Temporal Aggregation.} To confirm the contributions made by Temporal Aggregation, we removed this step for comparison purposes. The results in Table \ref{ablation3} indicate that TA can effectively aggregate local temporal motion features in ISTs and improve recognition performance.

\textbf{Comparisons of Different Input Frame Lengths and Window Sizes.} We evaluate the influence of various input frame lengths and window sizes on the performance of ISTA-Net. On NTU dataset, 60 and 120 are the two most widely-adopted input frame lengths. To ensure fair comparisons, when taking different numbers of frames, window size is scaled accordingly in temporal dimension, thus keeping the number of ISTs unchanged. The results presented in Table \ref{ablation4} suggest that using 120 frames as input achieves the best performance, and adding more frames introduces additional noise. Table \ref{ablation5} shows that, given a fixed number of frames, a window size of  leads to the optimal result, indicating joints can be modeled better at a fine-grained level.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

This paper proposes Interactive Spatiotemporal Token Attention Network for general interactive action recognition, which does not require subject-type-specific graph prior knowledge to model diverse interacting entities. Our ISTA-Net consists of Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokenization Block and Token Self-Attention Blocks. By extending an additional entity dimension in attention tokens, our design can simultaneously and also effectively capture interactive and spatiotemporal correlations of interactive actions. Moreover, we introduce Entity Rearrangement to preserve the disorderliness of unordered subjects in Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens. Our approach shows superior performance and adaptability on four benchmarks of interactive action recognition.
