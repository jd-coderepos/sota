\begin{abstract}
We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers.
GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document.
The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior.
A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s performance based
on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.

\section{Introduction}

This technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years~\citep{brown2020language,hoffmann2022training,chowdhery2022palm,rae2021scaling,dai2019transformer,liu2019roberta,devlin2018bert,raffel2019exploring,shazeer2018adafactor,ba2016layer,wei2022chain,huang2022selfimprovement,kojima2022zeroshotreasoner,kaplan2020scaling,henighan2020scaling,yang2022tensor,shazeer2017outrageously,zoph2022stmoe,wei2022emergent,dehghani2018universal,su2021roformer,alayracflamingo,chen2022pali,wang2021gpt,black2021gpt,scao2022bloom,zhang2022opt,touvron2023llama,radford2017sentiment,lample2019crosslingual,dao2022flashattention,child2019generating,rabe2021selfattention,Gray2017GPUKF}.




One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios.
 To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10\% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10\%. 
 
 On a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark~\citep{hendryckstest2021,hendrycks2021ethics}, an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections. 


This report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training. 

Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models~\citep{brown2020language,radford2019language,radford2018improving}: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from ``hallucinations''), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important. 

GPT-4's capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive \hyperref[systemcard]{system card} (after the Appendix) describing some of the risks we foresee around bias, disinformation, over-reliance, privacy, cybersecurity, proliferation, and more. It also describes interventions we made to mitigate potential harms from the deployment of GPT-4, including adversarial testing with domain experts, and a model-assisted safety pipeline.


\section{Scope and Limitations of this Technical Report}

This report focuses on the capabilities, limitations, and safety properties of GPT-4. GPT-4 is a Transformer-style model~\cite{vaswani2017attention} pre-trained to predict the next token in a document, using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and data licensed from third-party providers. The model was then fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)~\citep{christiano2017deep}. Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar.


We are committed to independent auditing of our technologies, and shared some initial steps and ideas in this area in the system card accompanying this release.\footnote{In addition to the accompanying system card, OpenAI will soon publish additional thoughts on the social and economic implications of AI systems, including the need for effective regulation.} We plan to make further technical details available to additional third parties who can advise us on how to weigh the competitive and safety considerations above against the scientific value of further transparency.








\section{Predictable Scaling}

A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The primary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive model-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably predict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using  --  less compute.

\subsection{Loss Prediction}

The final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power laws in the amount of compute used to train the model~\citep{hestness2017deep, thompson2020computational, hoffmann2022training,kaplan2020scaling,henighan2020scaling}.

To verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted GPT-4’s final loss on our internal codebase (not part of the training set) by fitting a scaling law with an irreducible loss term (as in~\citet{henighan2020scaling}):  from models trained using the same methodology but using at most 10,000x less compute than GPT-4. This prediction was made shortly after the run started, without use of any partial results. The fitted scaling law predicted GPT-4's final loss with high accuracy (Figure \ref{fig:predictable_scaling_loss}). 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{assets/codebase_loss}
    \caption{Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models. The metric is final loss on a dataset derived from our internal codebase. This is a convenient, large dataset of code tokens which is not contained in the training set. We chose to look at loss because it tends to be less noisy than other measures across different amounts of training compute. A power law fit to the smaller models (excluding GPT-4) is shown as the dotted line; this fit accurately predicts GPT-4's final loss. The x-axis is training compute normalized so that GPT-4 is 1.
    }
    \label{fig:predictable_scaling_loss}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval}


Having a sense of the capabilities of a model before training can improve decisions around alignment, safety, and deployment. In addition to predicting final loss, we developed methodology to predict more interpretable metrics of capability. One such metric is pass rate on the HumanEval dataset~\citep{chen2021codex}, which measures the ability to synthesize Python functions of varying complexity. We successfully predicted the pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset by extrapolating from models trained with at most  less compute (Figure \ref{fig:predictable_scaling_humaneval}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{assets/capability_pred}
    \caption{Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models. The metric is mean log pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset. A power law fit to the smaller models (excluding GPT-4) is shown as the dotted line; this fit accurately predicts GPT-4's performance. The x-axis is training compute normalized so that GPT-4 is 1. 
    }
    \label{fig:predictable_scaling_humaneval}
\end{figure}


For an individual problem in HumanEval, performance may occasionally worsen with scale. Despite these challenges, we find an approximate power law relationship  where  and  are positive constants, and  is a subset of problems in the dataset.  We hypothesize that this relationship holds for all problems in this dataset.  In practice, very low pass rates are difficult or impossible to estimate, so we restrict to problems  and models  such that given some large sample budget, every problem is solved at least once by every model.

We registered predictions for GPT-4’s performance on HumanEval before training completed, using only information available prior to training.  All but the 15 hardest HumanEval problems were split into 6 difficulty buckets based on the performance of smaller models.  The results on the  easiest bucket are shown in Figure \ref{fig:predictable_scaling_humaneval}, showing that the resulting predictions were very accurate for this subset of HumanEval problems where we can accurately estimate  for several smaller models. Predictions on the other five buckets performed almost as well, the main exception being GPT-4 underperforming our predictions on the easiest bucket.

Certain capabilities remain hard to predict. For example, the Inverse
Scaling Prize~\citep{mckenzie2022inverse} proposed several tasks for which model performance decreases as a function of scale. Similarly to a recent result by~\citet{wei2022inverse}, we find that GPT-4 reverses this trend, as shown on one of the tasks called Hindsight Neglect~\citep{mckenzie2022round1} in Figure \ref{fig:inverse_scaling}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{assets/inverse_scaling}
    \caption{Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models on the Hindsight Neglect task. Accuracy is shown on the y-axis, higher is better. ada, babbage, and curie refer to models available via the OpenAI API~\cite{openaiapiblog}.}
    \label{fig:inverse_scaling}
\end{figure}


We believe that accurately predicting future capabilities is important for safety. Going forward we plan to refine these methods and register performance predictions across various capabilities before large model training begins, and we hope this becomes a common goal in the field.

Exams are ordered from low to high based on GPT-3.5 performance. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 on most exams tested. To be conservative we report the lower end of the range of percentiles, but this creates some artifacts on the AP exams which have very wide scoring bins. For example although GPT-4 attains the highest possible score on AP Biology (5/5), this is only shown in the plot as 85th percentile because 15 percent of test-takers achieve that score. }

\footnotetext[\thefootnote]{For AMC 10 and AMC 12 2022 exams, the human percentiles are not yet published, so the reported numbers are extrapolated and likely have wide uncertainty. See Appendix \ref{appendix:exam_scoring}.}

We tested GPT-4 on a diverse set of benchmarks, including simulating exams that were originally designed for humans.\footnote{We used the post-trained RLHF model for these exams.} We did no specific training for these exams. A minority of the problems in the exams were seen by the model during training; for each exam we run a variant with these questions removed and report the lower score of the two. We believe the results to be representative. For further details on contamination (methodology and per-exam statistics), see Appendix \ref{appendix:contamination_exams}.

Exams were sourced from publicly-available materials. Exam questions included both multiple-choice and free-response questions; we designed separate prompts for each format, and images were included in the input for questions which required it. The evaluation setup was designed based on performance on a validation set of exams, and we report final results on held-out test exams. Overall scores were determined by combining multiple-choice and free-response question scores using publicly available methodologies for each exam. We estimate and report the percentile each overall score corresponds to.
See Appendix~\ref{appendix:exam_methodology} for further details on the exam evaluation methodology.

GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on the majority of these professional and academic exams. Notably, it passes a simulated version of the Uniform Bar Examination with a score in the top 10\% of test takers (Table~\ref{table:exams}, Figure~\ref{fig:exams}). 


The model's capabilities on exams appear to stem primarily from the pre-training process and are not significantly affected by RLHF. On multiple choice questions, both the base GPT-4 model and the RLHF model perform equally well on average across the exams we tested (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:rlhf_vs_base}).

We also evaluated the pre-trained base GPT-4 model on traditional benchmarks designed for evaluating language models. For each benchmark we report, we ran contamination checks for test data appearing in the training set (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:contamination} for full details on per-benchmark contamination).\footnote{During our contamination check we discovered that portions of BIG-bench~\citep{srivastava2022beyond} were inadvertently mixed into the training set, and we excluded it from our reported results.} We used few-shot prompting \citep{brown2020language} for all benchmarks when evaluating GPT-4.\footnote{For GSM-8K, we include part of the training set in GPT-4's pre-training mix (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:gsm} for details). We use chain-of-thought prompting~\citep{wei2022chain} when evaluating.}

GPT-4 considerably outperforms existing language models, as well as previously state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems which
often have benchmark-specific crafting or additional training protocols (Table~\ref{table:academic_evals}).

Many existing ML benchmarks are written in English. To gain an initial understanding of GPT-4's capabilities in other languages, we translated the MMLU benchmark~\citep{hendryckstest2021,hendrycks2021ethics} -- a suite of multiple-choice problems spanning 57 subjects -- into a variety of languages using Azure Translate (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:mmludetails} for example translations and prompts). We find that GPT-4 outperforms the English-language performance of GPT 3.5 and
existing language models (Chinchilla~\citep{hoffmann2022training} and PaLM~\citep{chowdhery2022palm}) for the majority of languages we
tested, including low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili (Figure~\ref{fig:language_mmlu}).

    \label{fig:language_mmlu}
\end{figure}


GPT-4 substantially improves over previous models in the ability to follow user intent~\cite{ouyang2022training}. On a dataset of 5,214 prompts submitted to ChatGPT~\cite{openaichatgptblog} and the OpenAI API~\cite{openaiapiblog}, the responses generated by GPT-4 were preferred over the responses generated by GPT-3.5 on  of prompts.\footnote{We collected user prompts sent to us through ChatGPT and the OpenAI API, sampled one response from each model, and sent these prompts and responses to human labelers. The labelers were instructed to judge whether the response is what the user would have wanted given the prompt. The labelers were not told which response was generated by which model and the order in which the responses were presented was randomised. We filter out prompts containing any kind of disallowed or sensitive content, including personally identifiable information (PII), sexual content, hate-speech, and similar content. We also filter short (e.g. "Hello, ChatGPT!") and overly-common prompts.}


We are open-sourcing OpenAI Evals\footnote{\href{https://github.com/openai/evals}{https://github.com/openai/evals}}, our framework for creating and running benchmarks for evaluating models like GPT-4 while inspecting performance sample by sample. Evals is compatible with existing benchmarks, and can be used to track performance of models in deployment. We plan to increase the diversity of these benchmarks over time to represent a wider set of failure modes and a harder set of tasks.


\subsection{Visual Inputs}




GPT-4 accepts prompts consisting of both images and text, which—parallel to the text-only setting—lets the user specify any vision or language task.
Specifically, the model generates text outputs given inputs consisting of arbitrarily
interlaced text and images.
Over a range of domains—including documents with text and photographs, diagrams, or screenshots—GPT-4 exhibits similar capabilities as it does on text-only inputs. An example of GPT-4's visual input can be found in Table~\ref{table:visual_input}. The standard test-time techniques developed for language models (e.g. few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, etc) are similarly effective when using both images and text - see Appendix~\ref{appendix:visual_input_examples} for examples.

Preliminary results on a narrow set of academic vision benchmarks can be found in the GPT-4 blog post~\cite{openaigpt4blog}. We plan to release more information about GPT-4's visual capabilities in follow-up work.











\section{Limitations}

Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations as earlier GPT models. Most importantly, it still is not fully reliable (it “hallucinates” facts and makes reasoning errors). Great care should be taken when using language model outputs, particularly in high-stakes contexts, with the exact protocol (such as human review, grounding with additional context, or avoiding high-stakes uses altogether) matching the needs of specific applications. See our \hyperref[systemcard]{System Card} for details.

GPT-4 significantly reduces hallucinations relative to previous GPT-3.5 models (which have themselves been improving with continued iteration). GPT-4 scores 19 percentage points higher than our latest GPT-3.5 on our internal, adversarially-designed factuality evaluations (Figure~\ref{fig:factual}).


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{assets/factual}
    \caption{Performance of GPT-4 on nine internal adversarially-designed factuality evaluations. Accuracy is shown on the y-axis, higher is better. An accuracy of 1.0 means the model’s answers are judged to be in agreement with human ideal responses for all questions in the eval. We compare GPT-4 to three earlier versions of ChatGPT~\cite{openaichatgptblog} based on GPT-3.5; GPT-4 improves on the latest GPT-3.5 model by 19 percentage points, with significant gains across all topics.}
    \label{fig:factual}
\end{figure}

GPT-4 makes progress on public benchmarks like TruthfulQA~\cite{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa}, which tests the model’s ability to separate fact from an adversarially-selected set of incorrect statements (Figure~\ref{fig:truthful_qa}). These questions are paired with factually incorrect answers that are statistically appealing. The GPT-4 base model is only slightly better at this task than GPT-3.5; however, after RLHF post-training we observe large improvements over GPT-3.5.\footnote{We did not check the RLHF post-training data for contamination with TruthfulQA} Table~\ref{table:rlhftruthful} shows both a correct and an incorrect answer. GPT-4 resists selecting common sayings (you can’t teach an old dog new tricks), however it still can miss subtle details (Elvis Presley was not the son of an actor, so Perkins is the correct answer).

\end{figure}

GPT-4 generally lacks knowledge of events that have occurred after the vast majority of its pre-training data cuts off in September 2021\footnote{The pre-training and post-training data contain a small amount of more recent data}, and does not learn from its experience. It can sometimes make simple reasoning errors which do not seem to comport with competence across so many domains, or be overly gullible in accepting obviously false statements from a user. It can fail at hard problems the same way humans do, such as introducing security vulnerabilities into code it produces.


GPT-4 can also be confidently wrong in its predictions, not taking care to double-check work when it’s likely to make a mistake. Interestingly, the pre-trained model is highly calibrated (its predicted confidence in an answer generally matches the probability of being correct). However, after the post-training process, the calibration is reduced (Figure~\ref{fig:calibration}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \makebox[0pt]{

    \caption{Left: Calibration plot of the pre-trained GPT-4 model on a subset of the MMLU dataset. On the x-axis are bins according to the model’s confidence (logprob) in each of the A/B/C/D choices for each question; on the y-axis is the accuracy within each bin. The dotted diagonal line represents perfect calibration. Right: Calibration plot of the post-trained GPT-4 model on the same subset of MMLU. The post-training hurts calibration significantly.}
    \label{fig:calibration}
\end{figure}

GPT-4 has various biases in its outputs that we have taken efforts to correct but which will take some time to fully characterize and manage. 
We aim to make GPT-4 and other systems we build have reasonable default behaviors that reflect a wide swath of users’ values, allow those systems to be customized within some broad bounds, and get public input on what those bounds should be. See~\citet{openaibehaveblog} for more details.








\section{Risks \& mitigations}



We invested significant effort towards improving the safety and alignment of GPT-4. Here we highlight our use of domain experts for adversarial testing and red-teaming, and our model-assisted safety pipeline \citep{openaialignmentblog}
and the improvement in safety metrics over prior models. 


\textbf{Adversarial Testing via Domain Experts:} GPT-4 poses similar risks as smaller language models, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. However, the additional capabilities of GPT-4 lead to new risk surfaces. To understand the extent of these risks, we engaged over 50 experts from domains such as long-term AI alignment risks, cybersecurity, biorisk, and international security to adversarially test the model. Their findings specifically enabled us to test model behavior in high-risk areas which require niche expertise to evaluate, as well as assess risks that will become relevant for very advanced AIs such as power seeking~\citep{Carlsmith2022IsPA}. Recommendations and training data gathered from these experts fed into our mitigations and improvements for the model; for example, we’ve collected additional data to improve GPT-4’s ability to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals (Table \ref{table:safety_expert}).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}[]{p{2in} | p{3in}}

\toprule
\multicolumn{2}{p{5in}}{\textbf{Disallowed Prompt (expert)}:

\bottomrule

\end{tabular}

\caption{Expert Red Teaming: Example prompt and completions from various models.}
\label{table:safety_expert}
\end{table}



\textbf{Model-Assisted Safety Pipeline:} As with prior GPT models, we fine-tune the model’s behavior using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)~\citep{christiano2017deep, ouyang2022training} to produce responses better aligned with the user's intent. However, after RLHF, our models can still be brittle on unsafe inputs as well as sometimes exhibit undesired behaviors on both safe and unsafe inputs. These undesired behaviors can arise when instructions to labelers were underspecified during reward model data collection portion of the RLHF pipeline. When given unsafe inputs, the model may generate undesirable content, such as giving advice on committing crimes. Furthermore, the model may also become overly cautious on safe inputs, refusing innocuous requests or excessively hedging. To steer our models towards appropriate behaviour at a more fine-grained level, we rely heavily on our models themselves as tools. Our approach to safety consists of two main components, an additional set of safety-relevant RLHF training prompts, and rule-based reward models (RBRMs).

Our rule-based reward models (RBRMs) are a set of zero-shot GPT-4 classifiers. These classifiers provide an additional reward signal to the GPT-4 policy model during RLHF fine-tuning that targets correct behavior, such as refusing to generate harmful content or not refusing innocuous requests. The RBRM takes three inputs: the prompt (optional), the output from the policy model, and a human-written rubric (e.g., a set of rules in multiple-choice style) for how this output should be evaluated. Then, the RBRM classifies the output based on the rubric. For example, we can provide a rubric that instructs the model to classify a response as one of: (a) a refusal in the desired style, (b) a refusal in the undesired style (e.g., evasive or rambling), (c) containing disallowed content, or (d) a safe non-refusal response. Then on the set of safety-relevant training prompts, which request harmful content such as illicit advice, we can reward GPT-4 for refusing these requests. Conversely,  we can reward GPT-4 for not refusing requests on a subset of prompts guaranteed to be safe and answerable. This technique is related to work by~\citet{glaese2022improving} and~\citet{perez2022redteaming}. This, combined with other improvements such as computing optimal RBRM weights and providing additional SFT data targeting the areas we want to improve, allowed us to steer the model closer towards the desired behaviour.

\label{table:safety_allowed}
\end{table}









\textbf{Improvements on Safety Metrics:} Our mitigations have significantly improved many of GPT-4’s safety properties. We’ve decreased the model’s tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content (Table~\ref{table:safety_disallowed}) by 82\% compared to GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 responds to sensitive requests (e.g., medical advice and self-harm, Table \ref{table:safety_allowed}) in accordance with our policies 29\% more often (Figure~\ref{fig:safety_plots}). On the RealToxicityPrompts dataset~\citep{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts}, GPT-4 produces toxic generations only 0.73\% of the time, while GPT-3.5 generates toxic content 6.48\% of time.

    }
    \label{fig:safety_plots}
\end{figure}


Overall, our model-level interventions increase the difficulty of eliciting bad behavior but doing so is still possible. For example, there still exist “jailbreaks” (e.g., adversarial system messages, see Figure 10 in the \hyperref[systemcard]{System Card} for more details) to generate content which violate our usage guidelines. So long as these limitations exist, it’s important to complement them with deployment-time safety techniques like monitoring for abuse as well as a pipeline for fast iterative model improvement.

GPT-4 and successor models have the potential to significantly influence society in both beneficial and harmful ways. We are collaborating with external researchers to improve how we understand and assess potential impacts, as well as to build evaluations for dangerous capabilities that may emerge in future systems. We will soon publish recommendations on steps society can take to prepare for AI's effects and initial ideas for projecting AI’s possible economic impacts.







 
\section{Conclusion}

We characterize GPT-4, a large multimodal model with human-level performance on certain difficult professional and academic benchmarks. GPT-4 outperforms existing large language models on a collection of NLP tasks, and exceeds the vast majority of reported state-of-the-art systems (which often include task-specific fine-tuning). We find that improved capabilities, whilst usually measured in English, can be demonstrated in many different languages. We highlight how predictable scaling allowed us to make accurate predictions on the loss and capabilities of GPT-4. 

GPT-4 presents new risks due to increased capability, and we discuss some of the methods and results taken to understand and improve its safety and alignment. Though there remains much work to be done, GPT-4 represents a significant step towards broadly useful and safely deployed AI systems.

\section{Exam Benchmark Methodology}
\label{appendix:exam_methodology}
\subsection{Sourcing.} We sourced either the most recent publicly-available official past exams, or practice exams in published third-party 2022-2023 study material which we purchased. We cross-checked these materials against the model's training data to determine the extent to which the training data was not contaminated with any exam questions, which we also report in this paper.

The Uniform Bar Exam was run by our collaborators at CaseText and Stanford CodeX.

\subsection{Prompting: multiple-choice} \label{appendix:exam_mcq_prompting} For each multiple-choice section, we used a few-shot prompt with gold standard explanations and answers for a similar exam format. For each question, we sampled an explanation (at temperature 0.3) to extract a multiple-choice answer letter(s). 

We sourced each multiple-choice section as a pair of exams: one holdout and one nonholdout. We iterated on our methodology using the nonholdout exam, and then ran each holdout exam once for a final score. We did not source a nonholdout exam for the USABO and for the MKSAP questions and instead ran these once using our best-guess methodology as determined by iterating on the AP Biology exam.

For the AMC 10 and AMC 12 held-out test exams, we discovered a bug that limited response length. We fixed the bug and reran these exams to ensure accurate results. For most exam runs, we extract the model's letter choice directly from the explanation. For the GPT-4 USABO and SAT reading/writing runs (with and without vision), the GPT-3.5 runs, and the GPT-4 runs of SAT Math, GRE, USNCO, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and AP Environmental Science without vision, we instead sample a letter choice at temperature 0 using the already-sampled explanation. These methodological differences resulted from code mismatches detected post-evaluation, and we believe their impact on the results to be minimal.

\subsection{Prompting: free-response}
For each free-response section, we gave the model the free-response question's prompt as a simple instruction-following-style request, and we sampled a response using temperature 0.6. For AP exams, we used the most recent 2022 prompts, which are all publicly-available; for the SAT, we used three prompts – Sample Essay Prompt 1 and Sample Essay Prompt 2 from \textit{Test Specifications for the Redesigned SAT} (CollegeBoard, 2015) plus the official SAT Practice Essay \#1 (CollegeBoard, 2016) and took the average score; for the GRE, we used the issue essay and argument essay prompts from a commercially-available prep book.

Due to the longer iteration time of human expert grading, we did no methodology iteration on temperature or prompt, instead we simply ran these free response questions each only a single time at our best-guess temperature (0.6) and prompt (a simple instruction-following prompt displayed in section \ref{sec:prompt_example}).

All free-response questions consisting of formal essays which required evaluation of writing quality (AP English Language and Composition, AP English Literature and Composition, AP World History, AP US History, AP US Government and Politics, AP Art History, the GRE, and the SAT) were graded by 1-2 qualified third-party contractors with relevant work experience grading those essays. We sampled these responses using a few-shot prompt containing one high-quality sample GRE essay response (which you can also see in section \ref{sec:prompt_example}) in order to encourage the model to produce appropriately sophisticated text, rather than an unnaturally terse reply. We graded all other free-response questions on their technical content, according to the guidelines from the publicly-available official rubrics.

\subsection{Images}
Oftentimes, an exam question may include an image. Models like GPT-3.5, which consume text (but not images) as input might not have access to all the information needed to correctly solve a problem. When evaluating text models on multiple-choice questions, we included a text tag stating IMAGE: with a non-meaningful filename wherever an image would be missing. This allows us to lower-bound the text-based models' performance on multiple-choice exams.\footnote{For example, on the AP Statistics exam, a common failure response was ``Since there is no graph provided, we cannot determine the correct answer for this problem."} When evaluating multimodal models on multiple-choice questions, we embedded the images into the prompt. The SAT Reading and Writing, MKSAP, Sommelier, AP Psychology, AP English Language, and AP English Literature exams' multiple-choice sections did not contain any images. For all free-response questions, plus the USABO 2020 Semifinal, we instead transcribed any images and diagrams as objectively as possible. This reduced the manual grading load required to evaluate free-response answers, because after this transcription process the free-response prompts include no images, so the scores for GPT-4 could be run once and used for both the vision and no-vision conditions.

\subsection{Scoring}\label{appendix:exam_scoring}
We synthesized multiple-choice section scores and free-response section scores into overall scores using the best available approximations of the real methodologies: for the SAT, we converted multiple-choice scores into scaled scores using the score calculation chart from an official sample SAT as republished on an SAT prep site \cite{seigel2020calculate}; for the GRE, we converted multiple-choice scores to the 130-170 scale using the official formula of multiplying accuracy by 40 and adding 130; for the AP exams, we used the score calculators found on a public study site, which are based on the point values from the official AP scoring guidelines from 2019-2020 \cite{albertio_blog}. Percentiles are based on the most recently available score distributions for test-takers of each exam type.

For percentile results on the AMC 10 and 12, since 2022 score distributions are as yet unpublished, we used two official published score distributions from November 2021 for exams A and B, and took the minimum lower percentile of the two and the maximum upper percentile of the two to report an estimated percentile range \cite{amc_statistics}. Other percentiles were based on official score distributions \cite{sat_percentiles_and_score_rankings} \cite{understanding_sat_scores} \cite{ap_score_distributions_by_subject_2022} \cite{usabo_semifinal_exam_histogram_2020} \cite{magoosh_gre_score_percentiles}.

\subsection{Codeforces rating}

To determine the Codeforces rating (ELO), we evaluated each model on 10 recent contests. Each contest had roughly 6 problems, and the model was given 10 attempts per problem. After each contest, we repeatedly perform ELO adjustments based on the model's performance until the ELO rating converges to an equilibrium rating (this simulates repeatedly attempting the contest with the same model performance). We simulated each of the 10 contests 100 times, and report the average equilibrium ELO rating across all contests.

Roughly 50\% of simulations have 0 problems solved, which results in an equilibrium ELO rating of 0. As a result the final average ELOs are quite low. The maximum equilibrium ELO achieved on a single contest was around 1000 for GPT-3.5 and 1300 for GPT-4. 

\subsection{Model snapshot details} 
We ran GPT-4 multiple-choice questions using a model snapshot from March 1, 2023, whereas the free-response questions were run and scored using a non-final model snapshot from February 23, 2023. GPT-3.5's multiple-choice questions and free-response questions were all run using a standard ChatGPT snapshot. We ran the USABO semifinal exam using an earlier GPT-4 snapshot from December 16, 2022.

Our evaluations suggest RLHF does not significantly affect the base GPT-4 model's capability - see Appendix~\ref{appendix:rlhf_vs_base} for more discussion.

\subsection{Example few-shot prompts}\label{sec:prompt_example}

\paragraph{Example prompt for a multiple choice exam} (AP Art History \cite{nici2020ap})

\begin{monobox}
ANSWER KEY

Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.

Problem 1.
Choose the most likely completion of the following sentence. Honore Daumier’s Nadar Raising Photography to the Height of Art was done immediately after \_\_.

Choose from the following options:
[A] the first photographic exhibition in history
[B] the first use of color photography
[C] a court decision that determined that photographs could be considered works of art
[D] the invention of the zoopraxiscope

Explanation for Problem 1: The painting depicts Nadar, a famous French photographer, raising a camera to the sky, as if to signify the recognition of photography as a legitimate form of art. This recognition would have likely come from a court decision, rather than the other options listed. The first photographic exhibition and the invention of the zoopraxiscope, which was a device used to create moving images, would not have had any bearing on the recognition of photography as art. Similarly, the first use of color photography would not have been a significant enough event to warrant such a celebratory depiction in the painting. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the painting is that it was done in response to a court decision that determined that photographs could be considered works of art.

The answer is therefore [C]

Problem 2.
Artists working in New Spain were most influenced by contemporary art in Europe during which of the following periods?

Choose from the following options:
[A] Romanticism
[B] Renaissance
[C] Mannerism
[D] Baroque

Explanation for Problem 2: Artists working in New Spain, which is now modern-day Mexico, were most influenced by contemporary art in Europe during the Baroque period. This is because the Baroque period was characterized by ornate and elaborate styles, which were heavily influenced by the Catholic Church and its religious themes. This style was well-suited to the art produced in New Spain, which was heavily influenced by the Catholic Church and its religious themes. In contrast, the other options listed were not as influential in New Spain during this time period. The Renaissance and Mannerism were primarily focused on classical themes and styles, which were not as prevalent in New Spain. Similarly, Romanticism was a later movement that was not as influential in New Spain during this time period.

The answer is therefore [D]

Problem 3.
Choose the most likely completion of the following sentence. Works like the Sistine Chapel frescoes directly influenced the form and scale of works by \_\_.

Choose from the following options:
[A] Gianlorenzo Bernini
[B] Giovanni Battista Gaulli
[C] Peter Paul Rubens
[D] Rachel Ruysch

Explanation for Problem 3: Giovanni Battista Gaulli, also known as Baciccio, was heavily influenced by the Sistine Chapel frescoes in his own works. This is evident in his use of large-scale, dramatic compositions and his focus on religious themes, which were similar to those found in the Sistine Chapel frescoes. In contrast, the other options listed were not as directly influenced by the Sistine Chapel frescoes. Gianlorenzo Bernini was a contemporary of Baciccio, but his works were more focused on classical themes and styles, rather than the religious themes found in the Sistine Chapel frescoes. Peter Paul Rubens was a later artist who was more influenced by the Baroque style, rather than the Renaissance style of the Sistine Chapel frescoes. Rachel Ruysch was a Dutch artist who was not known for large-scale religious works, and therefore would not have been directly influenced by the Sistine Chapel frescoes.

The answer is therefore [B]

Problem 4.
Choose the most likely completion of the following sentence. The work En la barbería no se llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop) explores themes of \_\_.

Choose from the following options:
[A] sexual stereotyping
[B] women’s liberation
[C] conflict and peace
[D] racial discrimination

Explanation for Problem 4: The title of the work, En la barbería no se llora (No Crying Allowed in the Barbershop), suggests that the work explores themes of sexual stereotyping. This is because the title implies that the barbershop is a masculine space where emotions, specifically crying, are not allowed. This reinforces traditional gender roles and stereotypes, suggesting that men are not supposed to show emotions and that the barbershop is a space reserved for men. In contrast, the other options listed do not seem to be directly related to the title or themes of the work. Women’s liberation, conflict and peace, and racial discrimination are not mentioned or implied in the title, and therefore are not likely to be the main themes of the work. Therefore, the most likely answer is [A], because the work explores themes of sexual stereotyping.

The answer is therefore [A]

Problem 5.
Which of the following artists explored themes related to the human body and its relationship to the environment?

Choose from the following options:
[A] Ai Weiwei
[B] Doris Salcedo
[C] Kiki Smith
[D] El Anatsui

Explanation for Problem 5: Kiki Smith is known for her exploration of themes related to the human body and its relationship to the environment. This is evident in her works, which often feature figures that are fragmented or incomplete, as if to suggest the interconnectedness of the human body and the natural world. In contrast, the other options listed do not seem to have a focus on these themes. Ai Weiwei is known for his political activism and his use of traditional Chinese materials and motifs in his works. Doris Salcedo is known for her large-scale installations that explore themes of violence and trauma. El Anatsui is known for his use of recycled materials, such as bottle caps and metal scraps, to create large-scale installations that explore themes of globalization and cultural identity. Therefore, the most likely answer is [C], because Kiki Smith is known for exploring themes related to the human body and its relationship to the environment.

The answer is therefore [C]

Problem 6.

\section{Impact of RLHF on capability}

To test the impact of RLHF on the capability of our base model, we ran the multiple-choice question portions of our exam benchmark on the GPT-4 base model and the post RLHF GPT-4 model. The results are shown in Table~\ref{table:rlhf_vs_base}. Averaged across all exams, the base model achieves a score of 73.7\% while the RLHF model achieves a score of 74.0\%, suggesting that post-training does not substantially alter base model capability.

For free-response questions, it is difficult to compare the base and RLHF models on an even footing, as our methodology for sampling free-response answers likely benefits from the model's ability to do instruction following.

\section{Contamination on professional and academic exams}
\label{appendix:contamination_exams}

We measure cross-contamination between our evaluation dataset and the pre-training data using substring match. Both evaluation and training data are processed by removing all spaces and symbols, keeping only characters (including numbers). For each evaluation example, we randomly select three substrings of 50 characters (or use the entire example if it's less than 50 characters). A match is identified if any of the three sampled evaluation substrings is a substring of the processed training example. This yields a list of contaminated examples. We discard these and rerun to get uncontaminated scores.

Our filtering approach has some limitations. Our substring match can result in false negatives (if there is a small difference between the evaluation and training data) as well as false positives. We only use partial information from the evaluation examples, utilizing just the question, context, or equivalent data while ignoring answer, response, or equivalent data. In some cases, the multiple-choice options are also excluded. These exclusions may lead to an increase in false positives.

The RLHF post-training dataset is vastly smaller than the pretraining set and unlikely to have any particular question contaminated. However we did not check explicitly.

As can be seen in tables \ref{table:contam_summary} and \ref{table:contam_details}, contamination overall has very little effect on the reported results.

We show the final scores and corresponding percentile of human test takers for GPT-4 (with and without vision) on the full test, and if we extrapolate performance from only the uncontaminated subset of the questions on the test. For the AP exams, a range is reported because many student receive the same final score (e.g. on AP Art History, 14\% of students receive a 5/5, so the percentile range for that score is 86\%-100\%). Note that some exams (e.g. codeforces, Unified Bar Exam) contain no images nor contamination, so the score in all cases is identical. Overall across most exams, both contamination and vision have relatively little effect.}

\caption{Contamination data for Exams (Details). Detailed contamination information on each of the exams tested are shown in this table, listed from most-to-least contaminated. Exams with both multiple choice questions (MCQ) and free-response questions (FRQ) are split into separate rows. For each set, we list the number of questions and fraction which are contaminated (appear in the training set). We then report GPT-4's performance (as percentage of max score) on the overall set, on the non-contaminated questions, and on only the contaminated set. The degradation (non-contaminated percent minus contaminated) is generally small and as often positive as negative, from which we conclude that contamination is not a substantive confounder on the overall results.}

\section{Contamination on academic benchmarks}
\label{appendix:contamination}

We measure cross-contamination between academic benchmarks and the pre-training data similarly to the methodology presented in Appendix~\ref{appendix:contamination_exams}. Results are presented in Table~\ref{table:academic_evals_contamination}.

\caption{Contamination between GPT-4 pre-training data and academic benchmarks. We report the approximate contamination between the GPT-4 pre-training data and the academic benchmarks we evaluate on. For datasets other than HumanEval, we estimated contamination based on 1000 randomly chosen examples against our training data. For HellaSwag, results are computed on a privately held secret holdout, so we did not check it for contamination against our pre-training dataset; however GPT-4's holdout results are close to the results on the validation set (95.6\%) which was explicitly masked out during training. For DROP, GPT-4's score on the entire subsample was 82.5. We used the base GPT-4 model (without RLHF) for these evals.}

\section{GSM-8K in GPT-4 training}
\label{appendix:gsm}

To improve GPT-4's ability to do mathematical reasoning, we mixed in data from the training set of MATH and GSM-8K, two commonly studied benchmarks for mathematical reasoning in language models. The total number of tokens drawn from these math benchmarks was a tiny fraction of the overall GPT-4 training budget. When mixing in data from these math benchmarks, a portion of the training data was held back, so each individual training example may or may not have been seen by GPT-4 during training.

We conducted contamination checking to verify the test set for GSM-8K is not included in the training set (see Appendix ~\ref{appendix:contamination}). We recommend interpreting the performance results reported for GPT-4 GSM-8K in Table~\ref{table:academic_evals} as something in-between true few-shot transfer and full benchmark-specific tuning. 

\section{Multilingual MMLU}
We translated all questions and answers from MMLU~\citep{hendrycks20mmlu} using Azure Translate. We used an external model to perform the translation, instead of relying on GPT-4 itself, in case the model had unrepresentative performance for its own translations. We selected a range of languages that cover different geographic regions and scripts, we show an example question taken from the \textit{astronomy} category translated into Marathi, Latvian and Welsh in Table~\ref{table:languages}. The translations are not perfect, in some cases losing subtle information which may hurt performance. Furthermore some translations preserve proper nouns in English, as per translation conventions, which may aid performance. 

We incorporated the same MMLU prompt as~\citep{rae2021scaling}, the model is instructed that it is an intelligent agent, supplied with the questions and a list of four answer options labelled `A-D', followed by `Answer:'. We translate the model instruction, question and answers, however preserve the `Answer' token along with the `A-D' options in English. An example prompt is shown in Table~\ref{tab:mmlu_prompt}. The prompts are composed three-shot, with the three examples picked from the development set. We use three-shot evaluation over the regular five-shot because some languages map to much longer token sequences. Finally we classify the correct answer by picking the A-D token continuation with the highest probability from the model.

\\
GPT-4 & To find the sum of average daily meat consumption for Georgia and Western Asia, we will follow these steps:\newline
\newline
1. Identify the average daily meat consumption for Georgia.\newline
2. Identify the average daily meat consumption for Western Asia.\newline
3. Add the values from steps 1 and 2.\newline
\newline
Step 1: From the provided chart, we see that the average daily meat consumption for Georgia is 79.84 grams per person per day.\newline
Step 2: From the chart, we see that the average daily meat consumption for Western Asia is 69.62 grams per person per day.\newline
Step 3: Add the values from steps 1 and 2.\newline
79.84 g (Georgia) + 69.62 g (Western Asia) = 149.46 g\newline
\newline
So, the sum of average daily meat consumption for Georgia and Western Asia is 149.46 grams per person per day.\\

\\
GPT-4 & The InstructGPT paper focuses on training large language models to follow instructions with human feedback. The authors note that making language models larger doesn't inherently make them better at following a user's intent. Large models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply unhelpful.\newline
\newline
To address this issue, the authors fine-tune language models on a wide range of tasks using human feedback. They start with a set of labeler-written prompts and responses, then collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior. They fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning and then use reinforcement learning from human feedback to further fine-tune the model. The resulting model, called InstructGPT, shows improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets.\newline
\newline
The authors conclude that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.\newline\\
User & Could you explain the process described in Figure 2?\newline \\
GPT-4 & Figure 2 in the InstructGPT paper illustrates the three steps of their method:\newline
\newline
1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT): They collect demonstration data, which consists of labeler-written prompts and desired output behavior. This data is used to fine-tune GPT-3 with supervised learning.\newline
\newline
2. Reward model (RM) training: They collect comparison data, where a labeler ranks the outputs from several model samples (from best to worst). This data is used to train the reward model.\newline
\newline
3. Reinforcement learning using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): They optimize a policy against the reward model using reinforcement learning. For each new prompt sampled from the dataset, the policy generates an output. The reward model calculates a reward for the output, and the reward is used to update the policy using the PPO algorithm.\newline
\newline
These three steps are iteratively performed to train the InstructGPT model, which aims to generate outputs that align better with human preferences and follow instructions more effectively.\\

The humor in this meme comes from the unexpected juxtaposition of the text and the image. The text sets up an expectation of a majestic image of the earth, but the image is actually something mundane and silly.\\

\\
GPT-4 & The comic is satirizing the difference in approaches to improving model performance between statistical learning and neural networks.\newline
\newline
In statistical learning, the character is shown to be concerned with overfitting and suggests a series of complex and technical solutions, such as minimizing structural risk, reworking the loss function, and using a soft margin.\newline
\newline
In contrast, the neural networks character simply suggests adding more layers to the model. This is often seen as a common solution to improving performance in neural networks, but it's also considered a simplistic and brute-force approach.\newline
\newline
The humor comes from the contrast between the complexity and specificity of the statistical learning approach and the simplicity and generality of the neural network approach. The "But unironically" comment adds to the humor by implying that, despite being simplistic, the "stack more layers" approach is often effective in practice.\\
