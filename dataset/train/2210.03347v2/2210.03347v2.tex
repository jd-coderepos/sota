\begin{abstract}
Visually-situated language is ubiquitous---sources range from textbooks with diagrams to web pages with images and tables, to mobile apps with buttons and forms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domain-specific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures, and objectives. We present \ourmodel, a pretrained image-to-text model for purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. \ourmodel~is pretrained by learning to parse masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, and image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy, we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks across four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Research on the interaction between language and vision has traditionally focused on tasks where images and text can be separated into distinct channels, e.g. visual question answering or image captioning. However, \emph{visually-situated language} is a far more pervasive way in which these modalities interact and blend together. For example, documents, tables, infographics, and user interfaces (UIs) are intended to be consumed holistically, without clear boundaries between textual and visual elements (Figure~\ref{fig:tasks}). Comprehensive understanding of this information requires a deep set of skills, including the ability to recognize text, understand language, and incorporate diverse visual context.

Previous work on understanding visually-situated language is scattered. The focus is typically on complex task-specific combinations of available inputs and tools. For example, document-understanding models~\citep{layoutlmv3} rely on external OCR systems, UI-understanding models rely on platform-specific metadata (e.g. Android view hierarchy)~\citep{uibert}, and diagram-understanding models rely on diagram parses~\citep{kembhavi2016diagram}. Domain-specific engineering can be effective for high-resource settings such as documents, where there is an abundance of tools and data available. However, these pipelined models lack sharing of the underlying data, model architectures, and objectives across domains, limiting their general applicability. Moreover, relying on external systems like OCR increases engineering complexity, limits adaptability, and can increase overall computational cost. Recent work on OCR-free, end-to-end document understanding from images~\citep{donut, dessurt} has attempted to remove such task-specific engineering and reliance on external components during inference by learning to decode OCR outputs during pretraining---a significant step towards more general-purpose models. However, the focus on text at the surface level limits the depth of knowledge transferred from unsupervised data.
